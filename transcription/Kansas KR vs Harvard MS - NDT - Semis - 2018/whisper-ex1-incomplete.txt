 Did anyone not get it? Yeah, but like I'd included everyone on the email. Cool. Okay, everyone again. The United States is a medical plantation. Anti-black experimentation pathology, pathologyization has institutionalized the idea that black women are disposable and unable to feel pain. This logic pays away for state-station murder of black women in both inside and outside the health care industry. Black women are dismisses psychosomatic when they eject harmful treatment. Any object to this violence is diagnosed as drapedomatic and expression of oppositional defiance disorder that will be in a hero's 18. Violence by police against black women is lethal silence about the murders. The points of dying the incorporation of the medical plantation into everyday life meets a history, biographical racialization of the medical plantations or violence. A black female body is the case. These cases are exemplary black women are disposable and whatever injuries onto them serve some necessary and legitimized part of gender sexual racial social order black women. The medical plantation and medical discrimination and medical crime are predisposed to the US population to view black women as everything but objects of human substance structural causes, including mis-black women as unbreakable, superhuman, unable to feel pain. All reflect the black women have been deemed objects for state-pilement, the policies about the black body and pain and the black body and superhuman are central to the cultural norms. The black women have been deemed object to the black body and that's all the overall if your information is accessible to the black bodies and the black bodies and the black bodies and the black bodies and the black bodies and the black bodies someone will end up admitting the gender male use of sex remainsbrendra option and the black bodies and the black bodies and the black bodies and the black bodies and the black bodies and the black bodies and the black bodies and the Black bodies and the black bodies and the black bodies rules believe that race is not as much of a problem as socioeconomic disparities, lack of resources, lack of resources because black people are crazy. They suffer from dream to media. Why? Most black people frame everything around race. It's like they're consumed with it every time you get into a conversation about politics. I always drag the discussion to race and blackness. People who suffer from progressive, dream to media, equate race with every political phenomenon. Whereas most white people don't focus on race. Specifically, activism that for France, political agenda at black community is treated as pathological psychosis rather than believing structural conditions. Black people are encouraged to pull themselves up by their brave threats and commit themselves to the political and social institutions in order to cure their dream to a medium, become fully functioning citizens at the Petroling River 16. Measuring culture defines how to find social racial order by the former madness that is located in the minds of black people to elitredemizing black protests by labeling its expressions as ADFC is not new white people. A tribute black resistance of various forms of tyrannism, stupidity, and psychosis for their effort to legitimize its particular white supremacy. The history of pathologicalizing black resistance has its roots in slavery. A new early in position introduced draped to media. Disease causing slaves to run away. Drip to media was curable kindness as keeping one's property well fed cloth for a proud feeling. I have to keep the enslaved one at night and so forth with the first cry of the end to go to the disease in the early 20th century black resistance was described as a disease of ADFC, such as Indian one, emergency to classify the unit. Those unfit for civic life. The delitio-demisational black protest was again on display in 1968 when the eminent psychiatrist stream a diagnosis of pro-text psychosis of the illness for the illness is oriented towards the city. An objection to the accepted superiority of white values contemporary attempts to delitimize black protest as ADFC reflects the scientific discourse of pathology. It has been evident of white critiques of black resistance for decades are hooting that black protest is granted in the psychosis. It's for precisely what allows for white people to sidestep the actual content of black activist demands and logics after a few many extent to punish black people in academic spaces, and debate. Any attempt to move outside of the boundaries of normal behavior is met with either fake niceties or outright hostilities addressing this pathologization requires exposing the terms of normalcy that under a current expectation of sub-students and academic sets pal 99. Higher education is helped to create a pathological myth about African-Americans, the oppressors having convinced themselves that normalcy of their pathological views have fostered a haqueous and among African-American students normalcy has always been assumed by the oppressor as a given in their minds normal is how they view and identify themselves. So if you're not fit the oppressors definition of normal, consider that normal, that pathological normal came to designate conformity to be normal, to be healthy and to finance oppressors, the oppressors have turned higher education normalizing enterprise justice positions with all agi-as-appacian educators are actively pathol-adjoicing African-Americans and higher education defines education has the authority to label the oppressors reality as normal and that's legitimate. While the other reality such as African-Americans has, and that's illegitimate, the education refuses to recognize the legitimate anger and frustration of African-Americans by labeling, the reaction says abnormal, Thomas and Solan have argued that the African-Americans anger is a sign of health, not pathology, the oppressor's mindset cannot grasp or fully comprehend what is healthy about the African-American reaction to their labels in order to survive the black, mean and women have led to the cultural paranoia which every white man and woman is potential and unless they personally find themselves that differently, and oppressors oppressors, institutions of higher education are able to analyze their unethical racists, believes in defining ways of defining normal and the legacy of the plantation and infiltrates the university, the University of St. Typhilite, Miss manifest itself through a process of forces that forces black people to assimilate themselves to white values and white methods of learning that's 2016. Across schools across the country students of color are showing and implicit, it's a socialized racism and creates emotional distance between them and their white peers, the basic assimilationists offer that schools make to black so you can be valued and rewarded in school and society, but you must first master the culture in the ways of the American mainstream since that mainstream as it is represented is essentially white in this means that you must give up any particular to being black value priorities, preferences, at least in the way the mainstream standing is to voice concern, to coin the term in the concept of double consciousness whereas whereby black people are essentially forced to have two identities, pressure to either forgive themselves, but both view themselves that they're perceived whether or not black peers is a psychology can create a unique circumsensor flexion today is psychology, some researchers are you may even lead to mental health problems mental health problems that go on notice and challenging institutional norms in higher education as a prerequisite to how that skills are deep. The concept of a chili climate in higher education context has been used to describe the experiments of perceptions of women and people of color can represent a nice way to say this is racism, sexism happening here, but you have to tolerate it, a culture, a cultural climate can be chilly yet manageable sustainable and slightly uncomfortable, the concept controls images of the acceptance of certain levels of racism and sexism that in and of itself represents a problem that it's important to not to acclimate or accept or to or accept a chili climate especially to achieve represents racism sexism and systematic oppression, the better social justice oriented approaches to it was as the analyzed work and challenge for improvement at least the practice and self defense from that uncomfortable cultural climate concept that addresses the sexist racist actions and then personal marginalized groups perceive within their higher education journeys that concept over simplifies equally traveling partially harmful effects effects experiments by some women and people of color and environments that are skillful in the order maintaining the scope and both affirmative to endorse epistemic disobedience and debate answer and fousers 17. Here it is a refuse little play the game in their test of anticipatory to regime in order to enlarge in the space for emergency for laboratory alternative that's going to be an epistemic disobedience is an uniscaled that can be learned through demonstrating progress or against learning the standardized learning it requires on learning what is precisely required for inclusion and success in the system at epistemic disobedience as a definitive rejection being told from the epistemic privileges is the zero point about what we are and what we have to do to recognize in such an efforts to combine black politics to conformity with the conventional liberal politics as a part of an agenda for pathologization that must be rejected that's has and hooker 17. Western normative presuppose universal western Palestinian grace as a exception to the normative black normative or a black radical tradition problem ties to the idea of western normative to conceptualizing racism is constitutive of the epistemic western normative culture political and educational activities by black population have been deemed a contaminant of the legitimization of the US democracy black protest movements draw attention to the unfinished project decolonization to humanization of black lies a common western normative critique that is rage that is that black rage is counterproductive and needs to be disciplined black politics points to the futility of directing active is in terms of regime fendin on exclusion and violation of blackness of poverty of the political imagination in inhibited by inclusion within existing structures means the foreclosure of more radical vision by acceptance of the quo and rights and a political possibility move beyond the state as a frame for trans-manor change transformative discourse and mobilization re-emigrating the subversive practices of black culture to coflipate more emancipatory transformative political immaturity such reforms black political activism to western state towards safeguard and rights have been denied limitations have been exposed by exposed by protest of black movements being political black activism is a great space to articulate man's editorial forms of activism you should actually the last line of the party are ready to black political act and the increased conceptual space for the more emancipatory forms of black activism you describe the potholes like yeah so our argument is basically the way that debate has gone about throughout this year and throughout the season has been in relationship to a prosoom normal see about what is what what this debate should be about we think that breaking those things is important we think that there's a pathologization well I mean the protest of the f right so our argument is the pathologization of what it counts as legitimate and what counts as a argument you say what we have been doing so far we protest that what should we be doing the point of the aphys that it's not up to us to make a universal prescription of what one ought to do our argument yeah to affirm the epistemic disobedience of the yeah that's what I'm saying is there like any argument we can make that wouldn't castle and he's the legitimate I mean you could protest a protest and you will so then you would say that the rules of the game should apply and we would say that the rules of the game should not so you can make you can make arguments that the rules of the game should fly but you don't know the rules of the game should apply then you shouldn't be playing the game no sure to get that but then you're saying you're on the top of these parts of passing the one EC as illegitimate it's bad what we just broke a new aphys we're not going to give you the case and egg and cross-ex dude but there is I mean there is one question and yeah you keep going well I mean I think that's what we were saying is that the epistemic disobedience of the apathy significant I'm obviously being spoken in cross-ex because as we said we shouldn't have to give you the one and see in the one EC but we do think that this is a particular form that's particularly important in debate when debaters are getting irrational crazy you don't go for counter plants people don't see your arguments as a matter of time. The question that I was asking is basically like you have all this offense about why it's bad to cast you as illegitimate and then you just sort of said like framework doesn't cast you as illegitimate and then just defense of rules of the game and it's like a regular disagreement. What do you mean? You're just said like if you defend the rules of the game that's not casting the money sees the rules of the game what is perceived as normal in this flow I think that there's an important portion of the money see which is the part where I said the debates that have gone out throughout the year I actually can't preempt the one and see that I can say that we've debated a couple times this year and what is presumed normal now? What is presumed normal now? Well we can say that it is that we are saying what is pathologized in debate act it deport I don't even know if it's not that was a bad word but anyways what's not normal as well so we can say the fact that you know the idea of what arguments I can't it cannot go for the idea of what teams I should or should not coach the idea that when we reed certain arguments it's rather a certain line we go for theory argument it's never really read as a theory argument or hardly fucking ever. What is the value of an anger? That's a firm's apost�ic disobedience that pathologian that that puts all of our enthusiasm as bad I don't think that this I think that you're not understanding I'm a very basic bitch because your arguments are very basic bitch so our argument is that the way that you have and the larger community itself has engaged in regards to black people ignores that you have the right to protest and that that protest should not be pathologized. Are you looking at a semi-use or semi-stash power? There are two semi-use power. I just want to make sure that I'm saying everything on that you can find out. I'm in semi-stash power. I really aimed at dissing a sash power but it's fine but just you can keep the water but you should go to the water. You should still do that.

singular model it's believing it is makes uh... makes negative aspects and that will make it impossible to engage in targeted ethical resistance that's he'd at all 13 academics need a clear exception who are well they are resisting not everything that occurs in the university of new liberal university is a complex example to structures values and practices something a place specific national and national issues that academic activists complicit self-cellaneous historically contingent capable of transformation this brings into view the potential for alternatives the current structure of new liberalism in the middle forcibly the post-plated versus resistance can also be nuanced and directed at particular structure practices or values rather than that the university is a whole list of obvious implications for the our prospects of sustainable action and therefore agency desirable changes have taken place we need he just forms a resistance that we believe our ethical and meaningful yearn-old i'll watch you up close every form of change the politics of academic refusal are themselves a disaster they assume a transformative potential for small women's and resistance that simply do not exist that's read in sixteen pre-political acts of every resistance it was all the recent cultural studies for run as it's just because it's just moved its merciless and continued resistance they ought to be considered an expression of politics themselves the political economy of academic life including self-reflection of trendiness in the act of the of love and courage i'm the lights into fantasy and political entry into the end for politics and criticism interpreters academic capital day person goes lead out to political action they don't anymore then the president carbon water leads to homo sapiens and for some politics is ubiquitous at development with a rare uh... uh... uh... which i did not read pre-gur johnson king and washington second third is that proper slow okay sorry i'm still what happened he wanted to ask that question uh... um... i guess what what is he do to come on card you talking when the brown card oh the windy brown card so i don't actually think that's the link to the brown evidence i did say that so he made the spot yeah uh... so the link to the brown evidence is basically that the one is he's politics is uh... akin to one of refusal or um... sort of episemic disobedience disruption but it sort of gives up on the institutional and programmatic imagination of thinking of what a good institution would be what a good set of social norms would be to govern human behavior instead of the one he says let's just sort of disrupt those norms and see what happens part of the windy brown and what's the concept of the picture evidence of how does it uh... reconfirmed the failure of the left or i guess what is it like to debate i don't even know this example basically so the vampires castle is actually the control of academia by capitals vampires uh... and so the picture evidence relationship to the windy brown card uh... is to say that the problem with the left is that they've given up on the sort of practice of institutional imagination in favor of uh... sort of moments of localized spectacular resistance and there's a part of the brown card where windy brown talks about uh... reworking our politics into a negative form of action the kind of imaginary revenge where we explain what we are disrupting without explaining what we build in the wake of that disruption and fisher talks about that as of like in in the example of so explaining why parliament is doing something bad but refusing to articulate why parliament is good are you saying that reverse uh... resisting something before we say what comes back to the future of that we're saying that you should also have a sort of programmatic vision for how society should be organized and it's very important for the left to think about that okay and who gets a term not determined like what that vision we should collectively negotiate it okay collectively negotiate so we have presented what we think that vision should be in that is oriented towards communism okay really quick question my campaign but what are you doing next year me yeah i'm like a student yeah no very human yeah sorry oh i don't know yet i haven't like taken a job or anything that is a possibility it's one that i'm like increasingly leaning against because of what we're saying this year yeah because of the process that you've made in the communist party i guess i'm curious no but because of the stuff that i read this year the classes i've been taking and so on have made me pretty hesitant about that so i'm sort of leaning against doing that trying to find something else to do but i guess when do we contextualize uh what is uh or guess who do you think in this slow controls who is like you know normal in debate and cross-active identity will probably be what you think uh what's important on a cool way to add out I guess the whole panel is over here. The numbers are erased but one, two, three. Thank you. Thank you. It's going to be case framework than the CAPCAT. There will be a short overview on the case. Is it going to be good? Okay. White protestors actively pathologize the medical plantation in the theorization of draped a media aka an illness that made slaves flee from captivity or private privilege and pathologist black protest as illness which you legitimizes and disincentivizes black protest the after forms of epicemic disobedience as deep pathologization of black protest we from the choice of individuals to be non conformist this academic practice is good and the way and with the way we legitimize the ability of individuals to relate to the political in whichever way they see fit only these pathologization for the government and all our laws of form politics that is necessary for every argument that they made which is that hasn't hunger evidence. Hey, Barbara, guess what single-payer good doesn't answer every KF. It doesn't compete with our argument because argument is that single-payer can't be good or that health movements are bad or argument is that the way in which protest to conformist the notions of politics and the political in the status quo or bad which is the first pair argument that will be heroic evidence sure health activism good but the way in which that health activism goes down shouldn't be pathologized or argument is that those activists have reasons for what they're doing and those reasons make sense to them and aren't ill-listened aren't bad the pacidami and not a model that's true which is why our epicemic disobedience also there are dominant notions of how there are dominant dominant epicemic notions that exist in academia which is not disputed by their evidence only of our academic disobedience that kind of fractures and ruptures the traditional men and rules and orders etc. It's good the refusal bad argument is not a refusal we're using all people ought to refuse with those who have reason with those few lot they think they should well all the should be able to validate individual rejection of conformity is independently good count 14 count four in the space created by TV discourse and you read it from the tip TV's can emerge work individuals when black community seems to have people challenges that was Jane Jan Justice?

They come to the end to such the read evidence is actively pathology and black protest, crushes movement's halftime, and stipends capitalist movement's wish. Means we link to the whole life and the ultimate of such change, 17 as long as the Jack and the Standard Public to reduce the serious linkage with identity, politics, will only lead to most vital sections of martial arts, you never hear the message. Made by white social movements, Michael's read, go out of their way, he's single out in a sexuality and a gender first, most over, and a class water care, pinning their responsibility for failure and black feminist intersectionality to political politics, which well by black women, this, they tied down the cherry fables for five land, the US and the Sulta battle between the labor and capitalists one, the cherry by capitalists, the academies of the West report, the evil and the search history, but the point is 1960, the class water delivery is the one, because the rule of the West was, with the fault of the might of the state, there seemed to be no need to prosecute this, cultural war, against a poor league defiant, identity of cherry and it's almost especially the one, if you have one to learn, if you're a significant part to reach the black women, just to make the, where the marchers are then insisting on, working class, you will only continue to antagonize, those are my wife who have been along with the long been organizing against patriarchal imperialism, racial capitalism, that's how the nation came up with, what appears to be so obviously, working class, thanks without, interrogating how the racialized and gender something you can't labor, that's how the laborers consistently, struggle with the fish, gravity loses them, the debate, the vampire castle link is a literally with all the decision, but the one, you see the metaphor says that, black leftists who don't pledge their look, he's a marcher, ravenous blood suckers, fisher, is a film critic that the altates just about Twitter beef in the UK, he also said it solves the, the aficioner, their key left wing, Twitter can often be a miserable, disarray, the disfiring, disfiring society, whether or not these exchanges are prepared to press the super paralyzing, feeling of hell, guilt and suspicion hangs over, left wing Twitter, nurses, this is the left-wing community, or a movement that these, he has to recourse it, to argue with all these and psychological courts who are with them together as mutual fear and a bit of information in the depression, there's no doubt re-enforcement inside these opposed graduate life, social media, and these there's little protection from the psychic pathologies propagated by these discourses, which are all lies from their, have that actively pathologizes, the informative, the Ferguson evidence is, also with all these black resistances, they're reduced to black studies, that, that, that, that, that, their inability to be good comrades, is because the political and therapeutic needs, who avoid scientific accountability, the aficioner's to prescribe a map, of being an embracing epidemic disobedience, is key to clubs, catarolles and McNill, and McNillo, and 12 to watch from here, and then here, obviously, but making an episode of the Washington's Blash, or qualified as people, as every behind, who needs to be registered to the moderating, among the personal learner, and what, means that he went from the illusion, and all that, and then he just wants to have catarolles, and then he just wants to be disobedient, and then he just wants to have, actually, when he went, he just wants to have an episode of disobedience, and since he's been given the amount, he just wants to have a birthday, but again, he will not go very far, means that he's an episode of disobedient. More in the corner, episode of disobedience. So, But you're good? Yeah. Okay. So what is the process by which the affirmative and domestic community should be pathologists, even pathologists black people? Epistemic disobedience. What is that? Walk me through how that path pathologist is black. Sure. The piece of Hesse and Hager evidence, and the one right before that in the 180, say that there are certain dominant epistemological missions that are circulating within academia that actively pathologize blackness and are refusal to engage in those particular discourses and to break the rules of that form of academia. Where are the norms that you break? Well, the norm. The norm. Right. The norm, or yeah, rule is in norm. So the norm we broke is that we are refusal to pathologize blackness in terms of black protest in terms of drapedomania or idiopithology, etc. The rule of debate is that you have to treat black protest as a script. No, no, no, no. It's a norm in academia. But we think that by selectively enforcing rules, you have actively pathologized the one AC, which is an independent region. Would you be by selectively enforcing the what rule could be not enforced? Well, we think that your enforcement of a topicality requirement is not a neutral gesture towards the one AC. What? What were you saying we don't enforce it again? Well, selective might be the wrong word. Our argument is that we're going to get to you in heck now when you're at the public room. Well, I mean, that was the realization. No, no, because the social context of those two things are extraordinarily different. It's not, I hate to say this, but you're being extremely reductionist. It's not just like we break the rule, you break the rule, or what we consider, like what's the norm, or what's not the norm. Our argument that what gives you neat is the argument is throughout the year the way that the discussions around not only black debaters, but about black debate itself and the relationship to the topic has been pathologized. The idea of the perception throughout the years of, I mean, last year's any tea champion, what we consider to be legitimate argument. If I go out into debate. I'm so excited. Well, our argument is that the one AC is, I guess in broad term, a form of protest that kind of protestes the social conditions that the fellow class blackness within debate. I'm sure enough to figure out why the norm that you chose to bring is the one that asks you to comment on. What do you think? Because we think that the kind of context of, like, dominant discussions of the resolution this year is the thing that provides uniqueness to the importance of our discussion. Like, JJ, these times, consider a wooden... The telling activists, for example, that you can engage, that you've decided, for example, to show up to debate. If you decided to show up to debate, you decided to keep the speech says, if you had decided to break this rule, then your shitty activists should agree to all norms. Yeah, no, I'm just saying, like, if you can select it, because it's what I decided to fucking do, because my name is no, because I can decide which things I think are good, and which things I decide, I think are fucking bad. And the idea that I have to tell black... Yeah, it is my problem. That's the point of the one I see. Yeah, but I'm asking how that solves anything about your arguments regarding the opposition to blackness. Because black people are pathologized in the quo and forced to engage in particular. And if you want to, you can do it. You can do it. There's your personal eye right now, speaking with which... I don't know what you should say. I don't know where it is. Did you get the cat stuff that I didn't do up or any? You know where I stand on the cat stuff. I didn't get here here or here. I didn't get everything else. I didn't get anything else. No, I didn't get anything else. You should probably think as I did this to you. Okay. No, it's not. Okay. And this is a little weird, but can you make sure that the chat is turned off on whatever it's like you... No, we're just gonna upload it later. It's not. It's too stressful, so I'm gonna pause it. We'll just hold the comments. Thank you. All right. Further attention. Now, as you see, best The order is case and then the case. Would you get back in time? I'm going to give you a couple of questions. Okay, it's in the end. Everyone good? Giving black folks health care will leave you a lot of Bounce political changes unpredictable. The problem with assigning pre-represents to doing politics is that the Barrier Supplytical Activism never quite disappeared and it will be a rationalizing inactivity even if we can't get rid of the idea of the black folks or crazy as a dominant trope of the until society is still worth aligning yourself with the political program the material alleviates the suffering of black folks that arises from the lack of resource access. It is not true that the trope of German and navitably frustrates movements for change for example the will be who are evidence we run the one and see talks about George Simkin's activism and agitation in favor of the Supreme Court case for hospital desegregation the decrease of death caps like giving black folks access to better funded hospitals the affirmative by contrast isn't really solve anything of the sort because it assumes the troubling the coherence of something equates with turning it down the simple disobedience brings about the set of institutions that we ought to have we all know the capitals and racism exists on a huge set of contradictions and the question is how we ought to politically orient ourselves so that we can take advantage of this. This means a history of medicine is not just as one big plantation there were moments of care and progress and regress that depend on a particular institutional backdrop which is why it would be an ought to be inside of institutional analysis and which we can come together informally particular political programs for advancing those things. The one of these ultimately aligned against those commitments in favor of epitomic disruption yes the one you see could technically allow something like single peer health care but our burger evidence is what you should cross by here in existence and never results in an infinite deferral of politics we always say yes technically it is consistent with what we've said but we can never recognize those programs as adequate or worth pursuing until we've done the prerequisite our point is that the one you see does not break down the prerequisite it still remains an operative normal politics but that prerequisite becomes an excuse for political inactivity the critique. Customists and refugees of pragmatic state based approaches for fighting racism are mostly successful because they fulfill need to rationalize our investment in the status quo they have advocated a number of important political commitments with the faith that sort of resistance will under destruction alone will take care of the problem which they pseudo active vision of politics that only locks in the status quo prefiguration is good and this is a thesis claim that all of these two easy cards have missed they've basically searched all of our authors within ten words of the word pathology and found a secondary article about it that is basically considered the thesis of most of these cards the central task of left ought to be prefiguration the refusal of the one you see to take a stand on the world we want the set of social norms that we should have is not simply a missed opportunity but the logical result of their politics which they defensive reaction to instrumental control that basic assumption about the failure of political engagement creates self-employing prophecies by constraining the horizon of politics which displaces radical world-transferring of desires in favor of sort of effective and feel good tactics which creates a perverse repetition that inevitably invests in failure is political activists that leaves us incapable of forwarding truly egalitarian social transformations that result in all or nothing politics that's objective purity demands which undermines any contingent or intermeasures for improving the world that locks in capital which is why you ought to center comedies in the same metric for political change which involves forwarding political proposals through lens of through lens of axiomatic commitment to equality that involves prioritizing creating the creation of certain kinds of subjects and social assemblages that are most capable of finding racial capitalism the impact is ecological disaster perpetual more in global poverty all this or anti-black but there are also external impacts the one he sees not attempted to theorize level on respond to your classes the only universalizable political foundation that's adequate to the scale of our impacts anything else extends neoliberal social reproduction creates perverse adaptance and self-coge finally polices the boundary of identity and defuses necessary solidarities it also causes more anti-blackness deterrence respectability politics which is based on a fundamentally classistic vision of civic life among aristocrats that takes on a racial dimension through the divide and conquer logic of capitalism which creates investments in particular racial identities in order to fracture the working class and prevent collective proletarian resistance to the private ownership of capital it also explains a draft of many diagnosis which was a way of rationalizing the plantation's distribution of power by denying black folks access to humanity the corrective is therefore to extend that universal foundation subjectivity by affirming that there is one world and everybody does have the capacity to think the here's the root cause of it in silent history shows the recovers the repression lies in structures that the black people to fight capital in the socialism race and design some individual prejudices with the nature of capital in economic exploitation more brutal than ever racism these just by the staff sculpt the world hundred biggest companies which was 70 percent of trade if they're directives included more block will not take any and would not make any difference the permanent depredue shape will only be to buy socialist transformation capital some shapes all of us in the time we are are born however the capital's class from the power by turning the different section of the word class against each other fighting particular questions hold back and we have now started thousands of times in our fact of permanently and racism in the US will require any capital in the United States to work in the working class and have to make a population of that win alone the social reason they'll turn to solve the ass down to one's federal because capitalism is the full-crime upon which material disadvantages upon which material disadvantages maldistributed throughout society for example through over policing food deserts access in ability to access good educational institutions and healthcare the permutation they shouldn't get one we win if we distribute any part of one they see non-topical off seven elevated responsible to defend every claim because they're able to choose exactly what they say outside resolution with each no plan text the whole aff is a plan text the perm is also a neck argument because the alternative includes the sort of analysis of the structures of anti-black civil society in the way that from particular tropes are used to demonize black people but it arrives at a set of contingent political acts the one he sees basically given up on the burger evidence about cynicism should also be cross-flight here and it proves a permutation results in an endless deferral political change the brown evidence is not saying that was not to find it's a mental disorder they have to rather the capitalism creates particular desires among people and that if we commit to particular activists strategies that are don't get outside of those desires then we're sort of condemned to repeat the failures of the left in the status quo this argument does not say that all black politics is the same which is why most of these link arguments don't really make most of their link argument so our critique don't really make any sense all black politics should not be treated equal and on some level there are some forms of black protests that are bad we have to be able to engage with those and it's not pathologization to say that those are bad otherwise it would result in a sort of conservative vision at standpoint of cosmology there are black programs of protest and institutional transformation that ought to be critiqued for example Ben Carson or the tea party that's obviously not what the one he see is literally saying but a mode of politics that says anything is pathologizing them if it disagrees it's obviously bad they're called about resortment being pathological doesn't really make that argument at all and it's a classic example of them searching Wendy Brown within ten words within ten words of the word pathologize it doesn't make a complete argument we don't have to answer it until the one hour flushes it out later they say disobedience solves the wind of attachments and the union establishes and say that is defending much more to make it much closer to the alternative which is a concrete program of institutional transformation there are a couple of link arguments that distinguish the plane from the alternative first for futiles not the same as prefiguration it's the opposite because it doesn't posit any goal place plan a program that would determine what the refusal becomes that seeds the political interests the black interests will not be represented in politics it is literally impossible to conceive of how the afs project makes sense once the norms that they're trying to tear down are actually torn down which is why the one he sees politics is fundamentally reactive instead you should affirm something that is good on its own terms and the military and axiomatic commitment to communism the Jane evident oh actually here's evidence for that last link approved the sustained capitalism with on seven established patterns of self construction have a fundamental problem the attempt to concept in the base of its up to the self the same from the market to contradiction late market for the subject or exorcism of the environmental destruction society is the lock in the maintaining increasing social inequality and environmental degradation country resource wars that policing potential enemies of significance of discourse radical change becomes evident when transiting institutions had pulled into doubt but when inclusion is important the estimate of let it be the latter is a social ideal by performing the alternative they cope itself for a majority discourse of radical change for red and arena for the experiences the authenticity of the alternative the Jane evidence is wrong because we're not generic philosophy grows reading car by eight all free as far from whether critiquing which is why we also criticize occupied for being racist the conflation of movements is the weaponization of past movements that read is critiquing their efforts also not the identity politics this card is defending what Jane would also vote negative the first last paragraph of the article include this way Jane 17 this critique comes from a place of solidarity jackman must be commended they can face answer and girlfriend serious critiques sexual to any successful political movement engaging meaningfully with feminist black startles and ensures connection to racist common sense doesn't happen because we're axiomatically committed to inequality we're axiomatically committed as well to the intersections between racing class which means our movement is explicitly anti-racism that's prefigured into the politics the Fisher evidence you're not reading the same Fisher or the same part of the Fisher article as ours they're cherry picking different lines from Fisher's rant about the Twitter left that is not Fisher saying the black folks have mental disorders and that's not how we're applying this to the one AC either so this has no link obviously we're not responsible for everything that our authors have ever said that's a totally untutdable model of debate they would there would be problematic for the after this links but the one AC does this sort of like critique of Fisher does link to the Fisher evidence that we've read about how the culture of linguistic call it ultimately becomes a sort of spectacularized politics that occludes structural analysis this works because within capital of academia these particular narratives are encouraged to be circulated because they displace any structural analysis that can actually threaten those institutions it is the perfect model bourgeois uplift where you say oh you know Harvard read this card and they should lose when the rest of the sort of structural analysis we're doing is a responsible one AC the last argument is that epistemic to be installed that argument is intensive of the Blutorne evidence if we go for tea we shouldn't lose for the critiques of these cards you have to weigh them against the dissads to the one AC and their vision of debate and the intersection between debate theory and politics topicalities also just a prior question we're of course to disagree with one AC especially when it's a new affirmative so we should be able to sort of kick out of these arguments and test them as well yeah I want to start on that kind of last line of argument about linguistic politics yeah so like the judges concluded that your critique of capitalism was correct but in the tune art you said the N word should you win the debate yeah we have to win that it's not as bad as the N word right okay so I guess how is calling black people blood sucking vampires that's the vampires the vampires are the capitals who control academia Fisher goes on a weird rant about white Twitter leftists who are critiquing communists that is not you and we are not saying your vampire castle analogy that you did for in the world the analogy is that academia the analogy is that academia is a vampire castle the app fails to break down the idea that if this is pulling the quote unquote grace car regardless of the fact that it's not there to be no understanding like you keep there's a belittling or and at least a visual belittling a certain argument that the affirmative has made and maybe I'm just reading certain judges incorrectly but I just mean to say that like if when is the threshold for you said something violent and when do we get to determine that you said something violent or when do you get to re-clair like to what extent can you re-clair you should debate about those things and we should talk about whether the re-clairification is an accurate description of what we said you get to say shit in the morning see if we were like that was offensive you get to say well first of all it wasn't offensive and even if I don't win my apology I should just still win that he was a procedural I get to test some racist shit out before I decide what I want to go for and I shouldn't we don't think the Fisher evidence is racist your caretaking lines you're gonna fly to the one you see well that's kind of horrible I'm gonna start with the kind of ability to explain drink to me this was kind of light in the two and T there is it is but where you gave just like proper mode of men people wanted to keep slaves so they made up excuses when people left yeah it's sort of a wave denying humanity just slaves and therefore denying a set of political and economic rights like personhood the set of obligations that comes with interacting with another person okay so drink to me yeah apply to people who led captivity it's sir or what captivity once that profit is lost why is it necessary for slave masters to the fellow guys basically we're saying that the history of racist medical diagnoses of slaves was a technique of capital to make a thing already lost that profit the slaves have already escaped captivity what benefit do white slave masters have and die who died guessing in the public and if it's just about robbing sure I get that question which is why you should look at the cell card we read which says the capitalism literally creates racist desires among people basically it creates investments in one's identity as the source of security or you're a fracture the pro sorry you're a green night all up no yeah green yeah but so it creates investments in those sort of fixed identity structures the matrix of identity upon which capitalism distributes difference is a means of fracturing the working class棋 com So I will be talking about T. Okay. Is everyone good? Your decision has to answer two questions. First, what is the impact of having no interpretation that limits the topic on debates? Second, what is the role of debating the first place? Only our impact is supported by a plausible theory of debating the first place. It's not good for making us loyalty in particular content, for political organization, or for altering your subjectivity, to debate it's just a technique that doesn't convey us to any single system of ethics or activities across the conceptualizing and engaging argument that's valuable. For two reasons, first is competition. If their interpretation can't reconcile with some semblance of balanced competition, you should vote negative because they're finding out a level of debate is a game in games or silly if they don't have boundaries on one side. We can't win change the topic post-factors, it's also a huge upside by the standards because the reason we spent so much time preparing for traveling to debates is because it has intrinsic competitive merits to make it seem worthwhile. Only we have an account of strategy competitive merit inevitably matters to people in education and practice. It's not the end all be all because strategy always asserts itself even if good debates can happen under altering divisions of the topic. Strategic incentives are inevitable and create general norms that push the afterwards obvious truism because there's an incentive to revise out anything contestable. After you lose to it, it's better to channel those towards an agreed upon status point both to improve the quality of conversation and to help us arrive at actionable strategies for resisting oppression. There's choice to break a new affinative debate where we're forced to go negative proof that strategy always fears its head and can't just be about education or community building or any other impact because there's strategic choice. Obvious all of these other concerns. Second is research, translational debates, focused research on the research and specific points of difference which encourages teams to develop third and fourth line responses to arguments and strategic process. Mixed debates new and interesting thus more exciting the judge and has a significant pedagogy of value and training has to think of through the other side arguments that rigorously vet our own positions there. Interpretation, explocal limits, just under encourages teams to research interesting wanting seats for the affirmative but absolutely just to direct to the negative that don't engage the nuances and pushes to the margins of the literature. Research turns our education off into makes us worse scholars and academics. They do not have a candidate interpretation. You should not allow a new one in the one year because of its changes that we just shaped our blocks. It's just because they are committed to a totally unlimited topic that has absolutely no boundaries they can create newness at the beginning of the debate which strictly benefits them results in a sale repetition of the same tactical situations in every 200s. Also a reason non-topical new apps are avoiding you should because the top possibilities are totally unbounded and none of our pre-run preparation is useful at all. You should think of T as a critique of their refusal to open their protest strategy to testing that shuts down all politics advocates have to make assessments while political trade-offs come to conclusions about serious solutions to challenging problems but the entire framing of the two issues that argues disagree with the opposite form of thought. If you have a proposal for a pathologist, this makes any disagreements about activists. If possible think of yourself as people adding meeting for a protest. If you come to a protest with a showing up without any knowledge of what that meeting will be about how can you come to any sort of conclusion about what that pro-kind of protest would be used to presume their method fails unless it can be subjected to scrutiny. There's no internally. So with the case against topical heats obviously the office not the F impactor in topical argument does not make much sense. Obviously vote for us if the norms that we have presented are good for debate and if we present it impacts that outweigh any of the reasons any of their impactor in argument topicality is not an effort to silence people you should think of as a critique of their particular strategy. A protest disagreement is not exclusion thinking of debate in this way is incredibly violent because it means that every decision you render is a form of exclusion of people every time you disagree with somebody else's argument you are excluding them or negating them as an individual which is a totally untenable form of debate it makes us. If possible for us to have any kind of engagement is that it's impacted in the overview procedural fairness should be preserved it's the only impact your ballot can solve it's really weird used to be to correct structural unfairness mixed between a violent activity because your body can be exclusively every friend of our people's people's social location who is more privileged demonstrate their model really pushes it totally. In coherent model of political decision making the voters and evidence is wrong about procedural fairness in game playing it's not rooted in whiteness and that's uniquely true for debate it's not an attempt to preserve structural unfair society but you most cases because you cannot resolve that with your ballots you should name for a procedural balanced playing field their vision of debate puts everyone on a privilege matrix. And for the less privileged person that forces messed up decisions about who is more or less oppressed you should not participate in it if that's the model of decision making then you should then you have to make assessments about whether he met the liar treated as Indian nation debaters called out his shifty and disingenuous or called us the model minorities that his perception that we have to comment its valentred away those implicit biases because this necessarily involves deep prioritizing a kind of racism against someone else's kind of racism wins don't really matter accomplish anything meaningful redistributing wins towards KU want to do anything to remedy structural unfairness but it will actively evacuate any potential for radical anti capitalist organization in this space or any kind of movement building within this forum truth testing argument it's not pathologization debate is a competitive game and there is a needed to be skeptical of your opponents arguments otherwise any disagreement is impossible if you come to the table just accepting your opponents arguments as presumptively true then it's impossible to come to any conclusion that builds third and fourth line research or third and fourth line argumentation on a particular question topicality is not never with the thought of decision they can explain why we read topicality gets like the employer mandate for the public drug insurance app which are not pathologizing those affirmative just we're the same. They're not part of the limited vision of the topic also the mystery top-county is a proper of negotiation where you can read different interpretations but that means that we both seats both sides of his seat at the table and have a process of determining what kind of topic is best for debate but they have not ready counterinterpreting so I'm not sure what offense they could go for on that question now the topical version of the F if we win it it means the opposite offense against he's not a violent attempt to exclude or an instantiation of anti-blackness because the exclusions are limited topic creates don't for close radical thought we didn't have to win that they solve perfectly to demonstrate that parts of the one EC could be solved in its vision for your up debate with arguments that solve different aspects of the case to varying degrees and imperfections are just negative ground there are many strategies that black folks who utilize to pursue epistemic disobedience that challenges the norms of the status quo the one EC is presented that one of the norms of the status quo is pathologizing black protest through to have to mean that their evidence demonstrates that race based disparities in healthcare are a norm that emerged from things that have to have to have systems or violent legal structures that encourage doctors to behave in a racist manner doctors are patients at the top of the version of the affidavit guarantees health care for black folks deliver by black doctors that would disrupt that norm powerfully they can teach you legal changes that right the reinforced doctors into particular of particular interactions with patients that can challenge the way that these disparate impacts exist now when the affidavit or deans and critiques make framing arguments about the importance of epistemic disobedience challenging the norms of status quo health care debates are not still thinking about single fear we had a great debate against KU in the Freelims where we had an in-depth discussion about the mechanism of reimbursements for particular services and it was a new and interesting debate T is key to unfamiliar perspectives otherwise it is impossible for us to disagree to have interesting one EC's and one EC's but no interesting rubotals as all TAPV is not pathologized in the affirmative is an alternative way to engage and protest to engage in the thischo this to cross Right? door. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. I'm going to go to the next room. Where's the carpet I got? They're like, you need to walk away. I need to walk away. It's like, where are you? I get that one. Yeah, it'll be KST and then the KST. Oh, I wish. Yikes. Do you catch? The affirmative sensitivity is shaped in medical plantation. I have other shaped in medical plantation. I have a stomach disobeyed and says necessary. Hester evidence as well as the pal evidence both shaped the way that we should understand. Aphysemic disobedience as it means to just identify from existing norms in order to create a possibility of accepting black, any type of black protest and without the need of pathologization. I said that it's existed historically. We can think about in the context of BLM in relationship to Florida or the relationship between black and the ability for black divators in order to establish arguments. We'll talk about a couple of seconds. But the offense that they read on the frame of hell, I mean, the offense they read on single-payer or go the permutation obviously saw because the affirmative says that health activism is different for different people. That people should be able to express their desires for health activism in different ways, which is reason why the LM is pathologizing different ways than other movements whose health. And this quote here shows a few of the ways. On the top of mind, the pathologization works to debate reading militian cards, regardless of the black person you debate, calling new scholarship, arbitrage, intellectuals and what teams are hired to coach, which arguments were expected to go for the nature of wherever I'm on CIDF to get a debate to quorum when to Joe Glitchellis and I read enough about twerking it was called people, called it aphroposmism, white diplomas, debaters telling black people that they're being too loud. The amount of people who come up to me and claim that my raise ability and contrast to other black people at the tournament thinking they'll agree with them the conversations that went around about the age, Rutgers, you met, they've ever existed, what is considered a legitimate and what is breaking their game to be quite honest. The idea that I have to sit here now in front of white men on the panel and likely thinking office as a reductionist, I hate this. What if Turner is buying it, knowing Fifelski, not might not be a fan of this argument, who's gonna find her argument reductionist with listening to me, et cetera, help. I got the cochlems, but I can only imagine what white people in the room are thinking, wow, this argument is someone new on some basic, wow, Harvard is going to grant them all of our arguments about what to be, or the idea of, to be being pathologizing, the idea is it possible that we write this argument to point out how reductionist humans' arguments are in every two in C and two in R against black people, quite possibly, we can respond what we wanna read and when we wanna read it in the negative, has demonstrated why the one in C and R form of protest is necessary in her picture because it highlights some of the things assumed about debate that we don't think it's good, offense on both flows applies to the others because they perform pathologization, can't reconcile the links we have to the right of wrong capitalism and can't go further critique without, well, because we point one on T, the way that their pathologization attempted do script black activism, okay, go on to T. The affirmative is a flight from the resolution to Haking, Refuge from the Master's Open Study, it's a homelike in this Harvard's entire strategy relies on a pathologization of line to set, probably gets served to media, there are appeal to predict abilities in a attempt to make slaps us on in order to forest, enforce punishment based on our particular seniors of resolution inquiry that they pathologize in the one ACN's ever ways, first and second agreement, might not be exclusion, but weaponizing fairness is exclusion that aligns on a first and second resolution to exclude academic protest and political legislation, which outweighs any counter-interpretation and express an effort to silence the voice of black women and say that I can only speak in the manner in which the primarily white community, they picked the topic, told me to speak it as an effort to punish me because it is non-conforming to white norms, new effort, commit the new effort, commit a slate and put all legislation every time, they read a new plan text against us, they don't disclose it and that's fine, but the same as the black divider tries to read a new effort, it's immediately unfair and about an issue reject them, for the slung of arguments, the fairness argument, fairness is a pretence and neutrality to make a historic norm of whiteness and a big suit of black people for the years of Wilders to the Netherlands as a black people, try and TV from norms of institutional debate, are immediately pathologized, that's my team to be, it's a white fantasy space and my team's whiteness and those pathologies to be the sun for your name, black people are because of pathologization, black motivators is aggressive and unintelligible, means we have to work twice as hard as other debaters to get, the square one I think I explained then on the case, made sure truth, testing argument is pathologization and criminalizes black motivators by serving, there are arguments to be used in false and less say, are in line with the topic, the app is a poor biotech, why does self-literature then choose to engage? It is not a choice, a choice my consequence, that the app traditional policy teams, whether they plan or it be an internal macro-moleist and the same with the black divider, so they need to test, they need to test and black flesh and take it if it's a medical plantation, will it be hard evidence? So that the construction of the current, it's low-sipolitics, relies on black flesh and the medical plantation, on protectability is good, the overwhelming, but overwhelming, which already debates on the topic have been, the single payer effort, so say, you can't plan, a state's kind of plan, which if you don't see, I'm gonna have to be eliminated. So I sell the literature based on health insurance, a T-carn's case, they could have made arguments by way, epicemic disobedience, failed or counter-threative, driven media, we didn't force you to call, we have hired so cheaters zero, they're called, there are other things that you could say, their approach to the living argument doesn't come to close to you, it's in your arguments and it's blatantly offensive, but it's affirmative, because our argument is affirmative, because I'm black, we have a method of delegitimizing protests, go to the TVA, it's telling us, protest is good, but you're doing it wrong, and the Catholicization, that's a Pellow, what's evidence single peer to faith, what if our discussions about truth and meaning, because the state's priorities, went there, go to the cap, from three, both the African, for sure, I have a mode of politics and said nobody could engage in politics or then nobody should engage in anti-capitalist movements, all of a sudden, it's a pathologizing alternative modes of resistance, that means that the permutation is all better than the ultimate nature, and evidence says that the checkerman's right-hand left, AK the negative pathologizes identity, politics is being irrational, that's the use, the alternative one means that norms of a conscious, necessary, demotivate activists who are returning, demotivate activists who are engaged in anti-racist politics, now which means that their movements do become white, anti-racist, white and racist, yes, a gene, it's from a place of solidarity, which is our argument that solidarity has to come from a place that allows for a variety of our choices of politics, which is the reason with the advocate, we get a permutation, we have a defensive, not being teed, they have to prove a reason with the advocate, it's an act of argument, because if you raise with the purpose and the negative argument, because it agrees with the advocate, cause they don't control the cause, there's a fundamental relationship between black women and the political, that capital says it allows us, a lot of will be in power, but it operates uniquely for a anti-climates that, for the Fisher-Revenents, they should lose for saying that if you have hair cast on it, they are absolutely pathologies, and they call it blood-socking hair, so you steal the life of Marxists, you don't get takesies, backsees because our argument is the attachment to that rhetoric, it is what justifies a current politics of the left, a co-inhabitants that- They didn't start that double-blind. Oh, yeah. They didn't answer the double-blind, a disidentification is going to the Montrex, and the current book, the bourbon evidence, says that either the F's epidemics, or the F's epidemics, or we're going to do cash in this day. I mean, what's the standard? I'm in a matter of it. What? Well, I think you should hold it, because I think we have a protection for the history of the French-speaking things that would be in the book. Yeah. It's not that hard to say. Yeah. I'm a good person. Yeah. I'm a good person. I'm a good person. I know. I think we're still a spot. What do you think it's simple? And I actually need to be kind of a good person. Okay. I think they found a new chapter for the book. Thank you. Hello everyone. Thank you. Yes. Thank you very much. I'm just going to give you a little bit of a quick introduction. I'm just going to give you a little bit of a quick introduction. I'm just going to give you a little bit of a quick introduction. I'm just going to give you a little bit of a quick introduction. I'm just going to give you a little bit of a quick introduction. I'm just going to give you a little bit of a quick introduction. I'm just going to give you a little bit of a quick introduction. I'm just going to give you a little bit of a quick introduction. I'm just going to give you a little bit of a quick introduction. I'm just going to give you a little bit of a quick introduction. I'm just going to give you a little bit of a quick introduction. Okay. The order is t, the k, and then the quotes. Okay. Is that any good? Cool. Topicality is a good number for reserve because it maintains this agreement, which is important for a strategy against both anti-blockings and capital-anthropy and to be competitive value to bait the opposite. The model of debate with you know, it's been no counter-interpretation where teams can just say whatever they want and the one AC disrupt, they want whatever they want but are never can be able to stay at a risky position on how the world should be different. There are two impacts. That first research, infinite new apps, scratch the neck, two thin and leave us with no role in debate channeling, competitive incentives into third and fourth line testing, if strategies are making the world better, who defines our scholarship as activists and trains us to understand the institutional backdrop of our society so that we can either combat or improve it, whatever your orientation is towards institutional politics that helps to know those details and that knowledge. He said, he trains a good, the one AC basically gives up on the big potentials of research community, say research community that's mobilized in favor of progressive institutional transformations, constraining yourself within the limited topic takes on some risk of being wrong but we can use that to cultivate it better, understand the world no matter what activist strategy you choose for yourself, all of our single-payer good arguments are offense-physic, it's not a panacea but it wouldn't meanfully improve the lots of millions of black people that say larger intro-linked the psychic suffering impacts of the one AC. The best way to bring that about is to research community that's consistently interested in advocating and defending the second impact is competition which is its own impact because debate is mostly about competitive merit and the quality of the debates falls and they become less fair, it's not good for anybody in the documents, a lot of value from the activity competitive, incentives turn any aff education offense, we can say it's conceited that strategy always rears the head, it's had in colors the sort of arguments that we choose to read, what does it accomplish at the debate community where every round people get up and announce they're disrupting the space in a different way, how would anybody learn anything about that, most of their arguments have role for the world, but not for contestation, destruction does not solve anything unless it has an alternative and that's a flawed theory of political change, the new possibilities sort of automatically open up once we've transgressed the norm, transgressing norms oftentimes only upholds the legitimacy of those norms, just ask if topicality was not a norm in debate with the one AC's political project even makes sense, if not the one AC's political debt end that can't lead to a man's fission, this is a brown argument on the cap-cate that they basically conceded the topical version of the app solves most of their offense because you could do healthcare for black people, buy black people that is obviously an active black protest but it disrupts the traditional norm civil society that prevents folks from making radical demands on behalf of the race in favor of colorblindness, you could disrupt the norms of impact, calc or causality on dissatisfying this particular policy of the government taxing the US to finance black healthcare for black people, would let you critique dissatisfaction, say the blackers should always be prioritized, you could defend as a flight from traditional norms of wing impacts or vowing lives of solves most of their arguments about why disruption is good while still leading the next summer role in the conversation, this is a predictability punishment, that's not true key, it's not punishment, it's a critique of the one AC's refusal to be tested, it's a disagreement about how debate should be structured and the relationship between debate theory and politics, the weaponizing fairness argument fairness is an important sort of value to maintain otherwise there's no protection against the domination of minority groups, fairness and this context is also good for black debaters, nobody would learn anything if you could just get up and say whatever you want, ultimately results in interesting one AC's but sort of stale and repetitive two-an-r's and two-an-r's that devalcivate a lot of value out of the activity for everybody, this means the fairness debate is not just fairness good bad in the abstract but how does it work in this context apply to this norm, what is it about topicality that's specifically excludes black debaters and they're very light on all of that in the one AR they say that we're tiny science black women that's not true the topical version the F disproves that and also it's not correct because we're just proposing a disagreement with the one AC in the one AC cross-ex they said rules good, it's offense against this, it's not an attempt to silence you but rather an attempt to negotiate around that critique of the rules, they say the new plans are pathologization that's not true we make new ass bad arguments against everybody we usually sort of go give up on it because it's a silly argument and we'll also do that against you, they say the fairness is a pretensive neutrality, it doesn't work our perfect objectivity but less fairness is regressive in the particular in the context of debate where less well resources, debateers love a harder time keeping up with all these new affirmations, this is the truth testing is pathology that's not true and this leaves no rule for disagreement if we can't test the one AC strategy we end up blocking ourselves into a bunch of really counterproductive political conclusions there are forms of black protest that are bad and we need to be able to critique those for example the black neoliberalism example from the two AC this is why you should start with skepticism for all arguments you should not so lettically apply that to black folks and we haven't done that either they say we don't criminalize new policy absence answer above unpredictability is not good because results in more still debates I explain above they say the topical version of the F is them tell is us telling them how to protest not all firms of protest are good so we should actually debate about which forms of protest are more or less effective single peer does single peer does solve this sort of draft many education arguments because you could make an argument about how we should finance black doctors for black people and say that's a sort of flight from the medical system you can also read this on the negative is the critique of many of the operative norms of liberal politics is the one you see read the oppression of the argument we're not saying the other professional one picture instead saying you should try to render as objective or fair decision as possible and avoid weaponizing those things against them as well pretty we're not going for the alternative they've dropped the blue door argument that the sort of spectacle of disruption the one AC's not an effective way of resisting racism or capitalism in fact it compounds the two of them because it is divorce revision for institutional transformation which means only the topical version of the F could solve it is the simulation of agency in little sort of cordoned off spaces like this it allow capricious to sustain itself otherwise becomes too grinding to be sustainable the permutation arguments they've made proves it's not offensive to require them to tack on a particular political agenda to what they've said in the one AC so they can't win any of their offense on to the official argument they've dropped basically all of our answers to this argument it is a random rant that Fisher gave about white Twitter leftist it's not in the evidence we read in the one and see and we are not saying that that is what the app is so even Fisher wouldn't say that's what the app is he's critiquing a totally different demographic of people they've also cut it in a really weird way to include single words from different paragraphs and construct a straw person of what he's saying first the depressive stupid thing is him talking about his own depression second the dark pathologies and psychological torturies reference to elite to control academia third it's a little bit new foundations of neo anarchism he's saying post-crab life induces anxiety based on his own experience that's not pathology black folks the phrase ravenous bloodsuckers doesn't appear anywhere in the carton inside of a capitol economics the case page most of this is answer about he you should not accept any sort of black protest on face we should have debates about which forms are more or less effective racism debate is not tied to topicality you shouldn't do the things that you say you're bad because they obviously are bad but voting negative you can think of that as a pick the challenges that things as well when it will continually maintain the norm of key to focus our discussions on things that can't improve the world yep so great It's going to be the critique and then the case and then T. I think it's really easy to hang your head on the vampires castle argument. The two and R is really good on all the shiny objects that you see throughout from the parts of their card not applicable to the app but didn't answer the argument we made about them calling the vampires that suck the life out of Marxist that means we're bad former with all bad former protest that is a direct link to their argument all their arguments in the tag of the one and C. Cardabout guilt and trauma meaning that we're bad former protest that takes the life out of good Marxist protest etc. All forms of pathologization they have performed in this debate they've considered the co-innovates from the two AC on the case that says the individual resistance to forms of pathologization is the only impact that your ballot actually has and he's sort of meaning on because they're in ran psychological and held in packs that you explicitly extended in the one they are that they have not answered and is the reason why all of the turns all of their kind of T is neutral etc arguments will make arguments about how their topicality argument itself is pathologizing but their card is literally meant to say and tag to say that they think black croat is guilt is guilt provocation and pseudo meaning that made up ideas that we do something in order to make our social radical the thesis of this card is meant to suggest that consent but thinking meaningfully creating political thinking that matters which used to be why the interracial which is the entire one AC about the way in which public approach is itself is pathologizing that pathologization isn't neutral but has to be read in the context of the medical plantation and treat the meaning etc. that takes the vitality out of the movement it shows which type of research their model is directed to all answer their kind of oratory T yards that they made on the case before I go to the case the blue horn argument is intro by the co-innovates which they extended but it also read this card a thousand times and it's so dense and nonsense I don't understand it the J-nevidence is much better that solidarity has to be informed through individual forms of identity politics that rely on common goals but differentiating ground which is what the F-dozen the entirety of the permutation that they can see it this also was a link turned to all their single they are good and actively activism good arguments because ever only rejection of pathology leads to successful movements which was a dropped argument and the terminal of that to T they went for is that we become better single they are advocates of only we solve the case they're super light here in the q1 r so I don't have to do a whole lot black protestors are actively pathologists let me do medical plantation and theorization of trait dominion aka illness that makes late sleep with the fluke captivity or prevalent today in pathology protest is illness the affirmative the firms episemic disobedience in which is in the form of deep polypide depatholization of protest is effective we've read that several pieces of evidence when most of we're leaving that's in hooker card and that come one that comes right after the advocacy statement and the one I see that says that episemic disobedience is a way to rupture norms that exist in the bait their argument about racism in the bait not being tied to the top of counties wrong we have made a huge uniqueness argument to fairness for like two minutes of the one they are that they fluently disregard as being unrelated or arguments that fairness is not neutral in the way that you can't be neatly divided into perceived role and structure but the way in which those two kind of interact in the confines of a single debate always is weaponized against black debaters because their pathologist being aggressive he's being aggressive or not knowing about the topic etc which is all the way of examples q gave that I don't have to go through they're obviously related to see because the term really had their going for fairness but they have not what a unique disordered even about fairness in a debate being fair now go to top of county it is a form of pathologization in the office of flight from the resolution taking refuge from the messer veteran city of some blackness Harvard's entire strategy relies on pathologizing blackness that rebel case of humanity but their appeal of predictability etc is going to have to make claims docile and enforce punishment based on arbitrary standards which is the whole one is the evidence about the way that drapedomania is applied in academia now which I think is the power card but I'm not totally sure the research argument truth that thing is a form of pathology it's a form of a form of pathology it's criminoses black debaters the whole thesis of their arguments just like if we weren't prepared to debate it because we're bad at research then you should presume the office false with that's obviously wrong in a form of criminality that doesn't get extended enough other tea debates the argument that we're good at research because I know that his we cut a pig is obviously true and first our model research is probably better the single pair good stuff I leave I've internal link turned on the capitalism they say they did the strategy focus colors all arguments with our argument is that that strategy focus can't be divorced from its general context that I talked about on the case of how that then we'll get to the land with strategies having the f then having to base about episemic disobedience are possible they can criticize the methodology of episemic disobedience we're having a pretty okay-cap-cate debate with kind of blue horned links etc. about the burglant link and then was refusal what they didn't go for that argument so I don't think that I have to answer it in this speech they say that the episod dead end politics we're not just topicality bad the f would obviously have meaning absent absent and normed requirement is the arguments about the way in which scholarships surrounding any child exists as a form of pathology that is based in a medical plantation will be hurried hurried evidence it's super new super good and really we're really impactful here the business we're not just topicality bad the single pair tv a they've dropped a form content distinction the path of the type of the system there like they that they can just tell us that the protest is all right and you can protest through single pair but the way you're doing it is wrong is the devil the kind of shit that cavernic can't be go through the pathologist that former protest that is independently better we've read a piece of evidence and they just have he knits assertions the fairness argument is weaponized in this context which is kind of the whole uniqueness of it i did above but the idea that it's good in a general strategy to have doesn't necessarily it doesn't disprove the willish in every sense of the way it's weaponizing is black and brown brown bodies in order to always focus today's kind of institutional reformism that doesn't mean institutional reforms are always bad but it does mean that we're always focusing on the bits of their pathologizing the protest that people who don't think that they can do don't think they can get the engage the bankerson example it's wrong our argument is not that black people are immune for criticism because obviously enter into the debate with an idea there should be some sort of role for the negative to contest the idea but there are dominant notions that kind of flood the academy that working the dominant modalities of knowledge that have to be contested bankerson obviously is one of the people who subscribe to this dominant modalities the less argument of the work is defense single pair only top of turk cheaper boring and having flexibility because obviously good states in the condo they're kicking less states in the condo they're like kind of stay on the affer rides up relevant form of education within the topic to be super clear saying he went for a pick in another debate makes this debate and this protest is not needed shows that their pathologizing us they perform pathology in this debate they've not said the
