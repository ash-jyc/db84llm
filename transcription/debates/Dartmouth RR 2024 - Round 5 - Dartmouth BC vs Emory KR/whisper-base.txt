All right. Yeah. Okay. The Soviet memory elements, the stuff about change must be material. There's parts of this card that say quote recalibrating the purpose of alternatively affordable theory requires recalibrating knowledge revisions that unmask our religions and the dynamics of dominance creates space for politics and resistance for part of the political change that you discuss is the one where we posit research that says it's posed that. Correct. Status quo is about the stuff about nuclear weapons and then debating nuclear risks is necessary. What part of the affirmative discusses anti-blackness in the concepts of nuclear risks? Well, we think anti-blackness is subsumed by a discussion of nuclear risks. I mean, yes, that obviously that was mass suffering and a little stuff about it. Other, other than just nuclear war affects everybody. How do you think anti-blackness has shaped the US nuclear arsenal? How has it shaped the US nuclear arsenal? You're right. It is like the Soviet shaped blackness in your back. It's better to say that we must unmask our religion. I'll reprise this question a bit more broadly. Do you think that slavery and anti-blackness is foundational to the US? The one you see does not take a stance on one of the most important power dynamics that has shaped the US. What about genocide and settler colonialism and so on? We agree that those are structures that matter, but just because the one you see is not taking a stance on that, does not mean that the one I see is unimproved. Okay, so my next question is, well, I'm not saying the one you see is incorrect. My next question is, is that how do you think the US got the materials to create this nuclear war? I don't know if you're ready to mind it. You're ready to mind it, where? Domestically or globally, is that right? Okay, domestically, off of stolen land from indigenous people in places like the South. I mean, that is an excellent reason why you should be restraining the nuclear use. You saw what the plan does. How does that, okay, aside from that, because you can see it now that this is true, what does the one you see do with unmasked or challenged those power relations? It's an under-defeated, like I said. It influences the heat for your energy. It's the heat. How? And if it does not change the nuclear, the size of the nuclear, so the only changes can we use it. And if it's operational shifts, they reduce the size of our nuclear arsenal. So nobody knows about operational countries. Sorry, what do you mean about operational shifts? Including things like the other thing, or nuclear forces, and they will chunk warning, producing the amount of nuclear weapons that we're having to say on the nuclear-productive or straight. Okay, we're going to reduce the size of the nuclear arsenal, where does the sale of the nuclear? Well, obviously, we've required some substantial changes, but it is very common as well. It's a single-dial, that says operational changes include production and modernization. Okay. Reject room cost explanations. What is this trying to create? It's not trying to create anything. Okay. I'm sending you right now. It's going to be one. Should be so. Should be so. So, thank you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

Okay. What do you just give us? Wish. Okay. Okay.我就... Oh my God! Okay. Okay. And this? Yeah. Operating endorses blackassumed. Yeah. Yuange. Yeah. Okay. We think it's a couple of days. We think it just be evidence. and simulations as I was the ending of the white world and Black Death, you think that one means to refuse the one he sees, practice or call to one in the worst mode of the POP also one that redeems the world's of society with the alternative and the outline is unredeversed. What's the most useful thing, such as heteronically anti-ducalism, the use of accidents and war, how is Black terrorism overcome those things? We think it's about the practices that the way or the alternative engages it. We think that one refusing to embeddle ourselves or even like engage in discussions of one thing is a form also. It's about gorilla living with safe and weaponizer then against hyper reality, which is the key internally to really see Blackness to rid you of this. How do we know that hyper reality exists? We think that the philosophy of this is very specific in the context of the ways in which there is a relationship between white and non-black. We think those understandings of seeing Blackness as not a person or a being, but as absence as nothing is what enables whiteness to determine fiction and reality to be construed around Blackness and some society of the majority of itself. I wish not to be accidental, but what do I mean? This evidence seems to be talking about things like the war on terror and the United States interventions. The affirmative prevents nuclear use in an instance. Well, we think that there's a strong correlation between that and the case of judgment. There's a strong correlation between that and absence. We think both rely on this understanding that the US is a sovereign entity that is to be redeemed. I mean, accidents are not US as well, right? But the way that we conceptualize how we get from point A to point B is embedded in this redeemed building that seeks things like, oh, the one AC is not inherently a military project. The answer to the project is what allows for a civil society to be really the happeners, but it's a very rough one. In the first place, I'm like, you're coming me on. Sure. Like, I literally answered the alternative, and you're going to ignore it in the book. You know, you need to AC is what we're supposed to do in order to play. The rich evidence? Yes, it justifies conventional shifts, the military industrial complex, and racial, global, and global racial capitalism. How does it have to be policy to that? Yeah, we think that means the resort. It says nuclear weapons are not so bad as an option. That means that other conventional weapons will be used instead of that place, or instead of nuclear weapons, which are more probable to be used in a college conventional weapons will be shipped to. I mean, I think it depends on what kind of, like, the MDs, ICBMs, equipped with conventional weapons that are like nuclear weapons. How do you trigger any of the scenarios that the affirmative police lived? Well, we think that's, okay, we think that's the issue, right? We think that it's about the ways in which we always get presented. It's scenario planning, which is not a counterfeit way, that black debt maintains happy-to-be-out-and-free. I think conventional weapons are more likely to be used against black and brown people in the absence of new weapons, which we think is our argument. The order is the advantage. Oh, sorry, advantage of the advantage. Okay. Is there a watch coming anywhere? Yes, sir. Okay. Okay. I was slow. Okay. I was slow. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

It was weird because I guess in effect, sort of kind of, but the thing that happened was that I got to the airport pretty early and then I had like four different flights to cancel. And then I ended up on one that ended up actually only being like 30 minutes later than my original flight. But it was like a whole thing. Michaela was buying me like Amtrak tickets to that's like a backup. It was, it was a little annoying, but we got here. Was it from weather in DC? Because there was like a blizzard in DC yesterday. Okay. So the border you just are back on the critique. The ontology stuff first, then the curve, and then it's going to be the advantage. The car should be set. On top of the permanently event. Yeah. So I said only the chain chain did come. But I'm going to try something. They should be in the like... Yeah. Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
