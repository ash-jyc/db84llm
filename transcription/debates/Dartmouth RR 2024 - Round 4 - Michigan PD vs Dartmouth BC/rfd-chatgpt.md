Based on the flow of arguments presented, here's an analysis and judgment of the debate round:

### 1. **Overview of Arguments:**

- **Affirmative Position (Arctic Policy and Disarmament)**:
  - **Main Claim**: Adopting an Arctic-centered policy that prevents first strike postures is the most effective method to mitigate nuclear risks and avoid accidental war. This approach integrates NFU policies and addresses vagueness in the American first strike posture.
  - **Support**: The plan is presented as solving the key issues of nuclear deterrence and accidental war, with a focus on practical disarmament and Arctic geopolitics.

- **Negative Position (Critique of Alternatives)**:
  - **Main Claim**: The alternatives proposed by the negative side, such as NFU policies, are insufficient for achieving global disarmament. The negative argues that their alternatives are more practical and address the issue of nuclear risk more effectively.
  - **Support**: The negative critiques the affirmative plan’s integration of NFU and Arctic policies, claiming that it is flawed or impractical.

### 2. **Analysis of the Debate:**

- **Affirmative Strengths**:
  - **Practicality**: The affirmative plan is described as practical and capable of addressing the key issues of nuclear risk, including first strike policies and Arctic security.
  - **Integration**: The plan integrates NFU and Arctic policies, providing a comprehensive approach to disarmament and geopolitical stability.

- **Negative Strengths**:
  - **Critique of NFU**: The negative effectively challenges the NFU policies and their compatibility with disarmament goals.
  - **Opportunity Costs**: The negative argues that the affirmative plan does not adequately address opportunity costs or the practical implications of disarmament.

- **Fairness and Framework**:
  - **Affirmative**: The affirmative emphasizes the importance of fairness and argues that the negative side’s arguments are insufficient and technically flawed.
  - **Negative**: The negative critiques the affirmative’s plan and highlights potential issues with the proposed alternatives, including feasibility and effectiveness.

### 3. **Judgment:**

Based on the flow and the arguments presented:

- **Affirmative’s Case**: The affirmative effectively argues that their Arctic-centered policy is a comprehensive solution to nuclear risks, integrating NFU policies and addressing key issues in a practical manner. They make a strong case for why their plan is preferable and capable of solving the problem.

- **Negative’s Case**: The negative presents valid critiques of the affirmative’s plan, particularly focusing on the practicality of NFU policies and the opportunity costs associated with the affirmative’s approach. However, their critique of the plan’s effectiveness could be seen as less robust compared to the affirmative’s detailed arguments.

### **Decision**:

**Affirmative Win**

- The affirmative side has provided a detailed and practical approach to addressing nuclear risks through their Arctic-centered policy and NFU integration. They effectively countered the negative’s critiques by demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of their plan.
- The negative’s arguments, while valid, do not sufficiently undermine the affirmative’s comprehensive approach or address the practical benefits outlined by the affirmative.

**Recommendation**: For a clearer judgment, ensure that each argument and counter-argument is fully explored and addressed, focusing on the practical implications and effectiveness of the proposed solutions.
