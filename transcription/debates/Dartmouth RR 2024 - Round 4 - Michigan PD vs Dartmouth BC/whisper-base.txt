All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. The Soviet memory, you know, the stuff about change must be material. There's parts of this card that say, quote, recalibrating the purpose of alternatively affordable theory requires recalibrating knowledge directions that unmask our religions and the dynamics of dominance creates space for politics and resistance for part of the culture. Well, we think the epistemological change that you discuss is the one where we posit research that says the supposed back. Correct. Status quo is about the stuff about nuclear weapons and then debating nuclear risks is necessary. What part of the affirmative discusses anti-blackness in the concepts of nuclear risks? Well, we think anti-blackness is subsumed by a discussion of nuclear risks. I mean, yes, that obviously has mass suffering and a little stuff to hide. Other just nuclear war effects, everybody. How do you think anti-blackness has shaped the US nuclear arsenal? How has it shaped the US nuclear arsenal? You're right. It is like the Soviet shaped back. It's like the Soviet shaped back.

Every time the wedding is a word of our million-of-life death, not to your- No, it should be in the middle of a real deal. That brings us to this relationship. Back to our million-of-life death, we said not to our million-of-life death, that's an open-door relationship. We're all like so-so-so-free. That's not being recognized. But it's your right to this intersection, that's not being recognized. It's an open-door relationship.

going to go to the lake, and interact with a relationship, and dominate by a sexual-affected, racial-economic bill upon the same-man-convigrated, a part of the incident, it's been invested into an order to reject some of that, and to affect the economy, so it's a little less interlude to the real deal than the same-man-convigrated, the personal-interlude to the immediately-medical-interlude and

It looks pretty mature.lands here, yeah. Yellow was the one that came out, that's great. That's awesome. Refused the one he sees practice or call to one in the worst mode of the POP also one that redeems the world So society was the alternative outline is Unredebate? It's not as multiple things such as heteronocontinu-chlorism, the use of accidents and war, how is black terrorism overcome those things? We think it's about the practices that the way or the alternative engages it, we think that one refusing to embeddle ourselves or even like engage in discussions of one thing is a form also It's about guerrilla, the linguistics and what not there at that against hyper reality Which is the key adrenaline to really see blackness to or to this How do we know that hyper reality exists? We think that the philosophy of this is very specific in the context of the ways in which there is a relationship between white and not or black and non-black We think those understandings of seeing blackness as not a person or a being but as absence as nothing is what enables whiteness to determine Fiction and reality can be construed around black death and self-assignment of the majority of itself I wish not to be accidental, but what do I mean? This evidence seems to be talking about things like the war on terror and the United States interventions The affirmative prevents nuclear use in an instant But we think that there is a strong correlation between that and that's it We think both rely on this understanding that the US is a sovereign entity that is to be redeemed I mean accidents are not US as well, right? But the way that we conceptualize how we get from point A to point B is embedded in this redeemed building that seeks Things like, oh, the one AC is not inherently a military system project Is what allows for a civil society to be really the happiness of being right? In the first place, you're cutting me off Sure I literally answer the alternative and you're going to ignore it in the E2AC What we're supposed to do in order to play The rich evidence? Yes, it justifies conventional shifts, no-tower industrial complex, and racial, global, and global racial capitalism How does it have to be policy to that? We think that means the resort Since nuclear weapons are not the option, that means that other conventional weapons will be used instead of that place Or it's set up into weapons which are more probable to be used in a conventional weapons will be shift too I mean, I think it depends on what kind of system, like the EMDs, ICBMs, equipped with conventional weapons that are like nuclear weapons How do you trigger any of the scenarios that the affirmative police lived? We think that's the issue, right? We think that it's about the ways in which we always get presented It's scenario planning, which is not a counter-free way, that black debt maintains happy-gathering for it I mean conventional weapons are more likely to be used against black and brown people in the absence of nuclear weapons Which we think is our argument Is there a way to probably get in there? Yes, there is one that I have to go back to the other way I was told It's not a personal person that owns an ambulance, it's a popular person who is a technology department In villages, it's getting crazy, so it loses their precious dance We've tried to go to an ambulance, it's not the most precious, it's not an accident It's an Allied or internal pressure set What's the US S-Clean? Yes, the IMH, our ambulance is there, all over the year and the next The British and the OSHA is just AI and the Intermediate Party building The US S-Clean is the US S-Clean is the US S-Clean is the
