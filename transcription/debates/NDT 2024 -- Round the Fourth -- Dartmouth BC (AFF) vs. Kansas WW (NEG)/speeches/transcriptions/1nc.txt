 First up is the declaration of the United States. 20 I I the the The DCM, the advocacy board, and the public, those of you on the legal obligation to create an act or otherwise require the remand of the war on the United States of America, in relation to the political and economic rights of the war-born, and the civil and religious political people, are in box number 60. We must begin to address your political and political responsibility, address the law and the fighting against the NYC, and advocate for the community's safety. The United States of America's legal system will be located in the Fairfax area, and will be disposed of, and will be made free of the care of senators. Of those of you who wish to march to the next office, the fiscal legislation, kind of, that the United States Congress should approve, adopting a new clear and efficient policy on the condition of the Department of Defense, ensuring the reputability and transparency of the United States of America, and the defense that now, through the federal litigation, ensure compliance, if the Department of Defense does not ensure the reputability and transparency of the United States Congress, now I'm also a student from Columbia. I have many issues over the fact that NATO workers use residual terror and animals. I'm already a U of L student, though I say, dude, question crying, digital video cooperation leverage capability trapping, I'm really committed to my sociosocial goals to NATO fans, but I've had to prove a day that I work in Congress, I need to feel a sense of property, ensure a dollar's worth, I'm more effective than the Congress, so I'll intent to learn to shape policy, I'll learn to make receptive tools, I'll buy security cooperation from Congress, I'm going to prove, obviously, if those two are sound, low tools, how the Congress is far richer, I said, obstacle, how to offer a great deal of facts, I'm going to have a negotiating call-out, I'm from the U.S. I'm American, but more ordered by conflict between over-tainted powers, I'm going to request approval from the NATO fans, I'll throw in fiscal laws, Fiscal checks were delivered, but there were excessive executive powers to defend them. In 18 of them, the Congress had much to bestow. In 27, the Secretary of State and the Foreign Minister of the United States, John Kerry, became the official ruling authority. Sooner or later, he would exercise legislative toolboxes, complicate child custody through appropriations, sort of per shivika, in different directions without appropriation, limiting priority in parts that are open to me to participate in all foreign policy. That brings a great sense of credibility.

Next stop is the Hong Kong Cataclysm. At least 30 states and 80 American states should convene. A strictly limited constitutional convention that restricts the first use of nuclear forces against the first use of nuclear forces. And a new kind of context. The Saults Inter-Politics deal. Since the convention is limited to the issue of the specific US-China-US states, and the application should be constitutional, the convention allows a lot of states to circumvent Congress. The unique disadvantage in accusing credible evidence. the and the state has since 22 been over-exploited. I have the view that's 24. And this FWSJ found Biden, Farrell, and Trump, that's, that's a lot to go over. We're worried about the only as risky as it will be. And only tells what things are today, with things involved. We're asking fully who to do too much. We have all this up there for data that's available. The liberals are getting to my mind as well. It's obviously being the F that Trump is underperforming.

It's a political dilemma to ride a ride on the Trump-Biden. A far more disordered order. He's running for major government, major pop wars, and Europe and the East Taiwan issues. We're running out for another year. So, we're on early world demand. Legion of German tribal, Charlie XVI, and I was here for 10th territory, but the German military are too well.
