Recognizing that the discourse on science diplomacy is still unspecific about how its means and ends should fit together and be comprehended, we reconstruct the concept and its discourse as a materialization of actors' interpretative schemas and shared assumptions about the social world they constantly need to make sense of. Science diplomacy is presented as a panacea against looming threats and grand challenges in a world facing deterioration. The prerequisite for such a solutionistic narrative is a simplified portrait of diplomacy in need of help from science that\u2014romanticized in this discourse\u2014bears but positive properties and exerts rationalizing, collaborative and even pacifying effects on a generic international community in its collective efforts to tackle global challenges. We conclude that these interpretative schemas that idealize and mythify science as overall collaborative, rationalizing and complexity-reducing are problematic. First, because the discourse misconceives ideals and norms for real and will therefore disappoint social expectations, and second, because science is likely to be instrumentalised for political purposes.'"

This was wrong for dynamite, submarines, artillery, smokeless powder, the machine gun, and poison gas.24 Was nuclear deterrence a necessary and sufficient cause for peace among great powers? Most critics of the idea of a world without nuclear weapons maintain that it was. They argue that the nuclear-armed states never fought a war against each other.25 This can now be proven wrong.

Moreover, nuclear-armed states have been attacked by non-nuclear-weapon states on multiple occasions. US troops were attacked by Chinese forces in 1950 in Korea and by Vietnamese forces in the 1960s and 1970s; Israel was attacked by Syria and Egypt in 1973 and by Iraq in 1991; and in 1982, Argentina invaded the British Falkland Islands.27 This narrows down the claims for nuclear weapons as peacemakers. More importantly, even this narrower claim needs to be reexamined taking into account two facts: (1) avoidance of several nuclear disasters was due to luck and cannot be explained by nuclear deterrence; and (2) deterrence as a strategy has favored more risk-prone strategies and in some cases made war possible instead of preventing it.'"

Pelopidas (2011) exposes and critiques this \u201cproliferation paradigm\u201d as a politicized reading of nuclear history that imagines the deterministic spread of nuclear weapons as a metaphorical \u201ccontagion\u201d in international society driven by shared ideas about innate and positive qualities of nuclear weapons. He shows how this generates \u201crequirements\u201d for control, surveillance, punishment and nuclear threat-making to establish obstacles in the way of the weapons' \u201cinevitable\u201d spread that must be actively contained. It is based on a view of nuclear proliferation as a natural and linear \u201cchain reaction\u201d or \u201cdomino effect\u201d that takes on a momentum of its own, ignoring what Muller and Schmidt (2010) identify as the \u201cphenomenon of deproliferation.\u201d Proliferationism, in turn, reflects a broadly Western form of nuclear exceptionalism in which the liberal values underpinning Western polities justify selective possession of nuclear weapons. This view suggests that nuclear weapons are not morally equivalent: Western nuclear weapons are inherently legitimate and good for international peace and security; those in the hands of authoritarian states or states beyond the West's sphere of influence are illegitimate and undermine a Western understanding of international order (Cooper, 2006, pp. 370\u2013374). More broadly, the suppliers of nuclear technology by whom control is exerted are the \u201cstates of the advanced industrialized world\u201d and their allies, recipients are those outside this privileged group, with rogues cast as deviants who challenge this hierarchy (Mutimer, 2000, p. 157). This view frames the spread of nuclear weapons as \u201cthe greatest single threat to world security for the rest of our lives\u201d in the words of Krauthammer (1990), who urges the West \u201cto police these weapons and those who brandish them\u201d (p. 32) and insists there is no one to do that but the United States.'"

First, in each case, change was precipitated by the stigmatization of the practice or object in question and emergence of new conceptions of appropriate action. Second, in some cases, such as the processes of nuclear relinquishment by South Africa and the three post-Soviet republics, and arguably a number of nonnuclear disarmament processes such as the renunciation of biological weapons by the United States in the context of the turmoil of the Vietnam War, change appears to have been aided by wider political commotion or exogenous shocks. In other cases, perhaps most notably the British abolition of the slave trade and multiple instances of nuclear rollback and nonnuclear disarmament, change occurred during periods of relative political stability. Third, security circumstances varied significantly across the cases discussed. While improved security conditions undoubtedly helped foster or allow for change in many cases, improved security conditions were often facilitated by the very processes under discussion. In some cases, such as the Swedish nuclear reversal, and arguably the cases of disarmament by the three post- Soviet states, renunciation was pushed through in spite of what seemed a threatening or at the very least uncertain security environment. A final observation is that, while diplomacy was of great importance in many cases, change invariably took place through unilateral, domestic action. The only exception is the U.S.\u2013Russian arms control process, through which agreements have been based on formal reciprocity and a logic of incrementalism. As established above, however, the history of arms control arguably holds low evidentiary value for theorizing about nuclear renunciation.'"

For example, in the 1970s, President Park Chung Hee initiated a program to develop nuclear weapons in response to a proposal by the United States to withdraw troops from South Korea. 138 Under immense pressure, the United States withdrew from the plan and thereafter, South Korea ceased to pursue its own nuclear deterrents. 139'"

GOLDILOCKS---even if each area contained no subsets, it'd be perfect for a nuclear topic.' | cite: 'Rob Glass & Jeffrey Lewis, former debater and Director of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, 18, Rob Glass runs the DebaterCast Podcast; Dr. Jeffrey Lewis is the Director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey and the founding editor of the Arms Control Wonk blog, \u201cDebaterCast Episode 04 \u2013 Dr. Jeffrey Lewis,\u201d DebaterCast, 09/11/18, https://debatercast.com/2018/09/episode-04-dr-jeffrey-lewis/' | contents: 'LEWIS: Okay so, launch on warning, which again, people prefer launch under attack as a phrase, but that is the idea that instead of riding out an attack and then retaliating, that you want to begin executing your retaliation prior to the enemy completing its attack. So that's the scenario where there are a hundred Russian missiles launched, maybe a few of them have reached the United States, maybe none of them have reached the United States, but you know they're coming. And so then you want to then undertake your retaliation while the attack is still underway, both so that your forces aren't destroyed, but also so that you might limit some of the damage that is coming your way. There are things to be said for that policy, but obviously that is the system that requires an aide follow the president around with the football at all times, and requires the president to have a command-and-control system that allows the kind of immediate authorization of the use of nuclear weapons and precludes Congress from being involved. I would be - I would get rid of that posture. No first use is a declaration, so it's a pledge that you would not use nuclear weapons first in a conflict. It seems very reasonable. I think it is very reasonable. It is anathema to Western defense planners, traditionally because they believe the United States may wish to use nuclear weapons on behalf of allies that are attacked, but I think more generally, there is a deeper issue, which is they don't like stigmatizing the use of nuclear weapons. I think they believe that that would undermine deterrence. I don't find that very compelling, but they think that. There's another proposal that Scott Sagan and I have made, which I don't know if it would be topical, but I'd sure love to see people make the argument. It's a funny thing, the way that strategic command talks about the law of armed conflict. There's this idea in the law of armed conflict of military necessity that you shouldn't do something in a conflict unless it's necessary, which is pretty reasonable - you don't blow up a school just to blow up a school because of the fun, there has to be some purpose right behind this action. There is this funny thing, which is that they don't actually require that for nuclear weapons. They don't have a requirement that it must be necessary to use a nuclear weapon instead of, say, a conventional one. They only say, is it necessary to destroy the target, and if it is, then you can use whatever you'd like. And I think that's a very dangerous thing to say because often when you ask people, do you need a nuclear weapon to destroy this target, what they'll say is, well, but there's a unique psychological impact to using a nuclear weapon. And if you really interrogate them in terms of what they mean by unique psychological impact, what they really mean is terror bombing. It would scare the shit out of people. That's not permissible. That's not a permissible reason to use a particular type of weapon. My colleague at Stanford, Scott Sagan, and I, we propose that as a matter of policy, the president say that the United States would never use a nuclear weapon in a situation where a conventional weapon would be sufficient. I happen to think that that's the correct legal interpretation of the law of armed conflict, but that's a sort of separate question from what one thinks the right moral choice would be. Congress could arguably require that. I don't - I'm not as good of a topicality debater as I was back in the day, but I think you could probably find a way to make that make that - I'll certainly say this: it is a real proposal and just defining things by ground, you know, making sure that is enough ground for a reasonable number of debate cases, it certainly is one that I would consider. There was this year in high school, I was in college, so I was a coach but it was the healthcare topic. There was literally one case.'"

Gregory Albo and Leo Panitch, p. 299-322)' | contents: 'Whatever it may have been at earlier historical moments, antiracism as a contemporary politics is not necessarily aligned with projects of broad social transformation animated by the egalitarian vision that prompted the twentieth century's iconic revolutions. Rather, antiracist politics in the United States and elsewhere in the West and much of Latin America can be, and often enough has been, an antagonistic alternative to such projects of broad transformation. That is, notwithstanding a persistent inclination among leftists to consider it a discourse at least in dialogue with the left, antiracism is as likely now to be an ideological and practical programme that fits more comfortably within neoliberalism than with a socialist left. In the United States especially, but increasingly in Western Europe and Canada also, antiracism and other political tendencies based on ascriptive identities \u2013 that is, those expressing what one supposedly is rather than what one does2 \u2013 commonly reject Marxist and other socialist politics as insufficiently attentive, if not inimical, to the special position and needs of racial or other ascriptively defined populations understood to be oppressed in ways that are not causally or most consequentially rooted in capitalist political economy. In fact, these tendencies commonly object to the universalizing perspectives associated with socialism and Marxism in particular as Eurocentric (or phallocentric, or heteronormative) homogenization that denies the specificity of ascriptive groups' distinctive perspectives, grievances and demands. To the extent the political orientation from which antiracist and other identity-based tendencies proceed is more \u2018groupist' than broadly solidaristic, the vision of a just society around which they cohere can be more in line with liberal interest-group pluralism than with a left that relates its lineage or marks its affinities to the broad tradition that generated the revolutionary movements of the last century. Eric Hobsbawm pointed to this tension in the mid-1990s indicating that, while the left naturally has supported movements advocating for the rights of stigmatized groups, identity groups \u2018are not committed to the Left as such, but only to get support for their cause wherever they can'.3 Openness to this kind of politics stems partly, as Hobsbawm points out, from the left reflex to support the cause of the oppressed. The victories won in the second half of the twentieth century against ideologies and regimes of ascriptive hierarchy, chiefly those grounded on narratives of race and gender, made leftists, and labour, all the more conscious of past failings with respect to inattentiveness to, acceptance or even overt embrace of ascriptive inegalitarianism. The generation of leftists who emerged in the 1960s came of age with the militant anti-colonial movements and national liberation struggles in what was then known as the Third World, the civil rights struggle in the United States, and anti-apartheid struggles in South Africa, as well as the resurgent women's movement. That generation was also likely to be self-critical regarding what were perceived as failings and limitations \u2013 some would say ossification, even debasement or perversion \u2013 of the dominant practical models of socialism in Eastern Europe and elsewhere on the capitalist periphery. The New Left generation's inclination to criticize \u2018really existing socialism' extended also to the orthodox Marxist parties in the West, which were easily enough seen as out of touch with the new spirit of insurgency coming from youth, minority groups in advanced capitalist societies, and Third World movements of national liberation. In the US, many displayed similar scepticism toward the trade union movement, which in the eyes of many radicals had settled into a narrow, self-interested class collaborationism. This is a familiar story to Socialist Register readers, and one I summarize very schematically. In addition to Hobsbawm's account mentioned above, Leo Panitch and the late Ellen Meiksins Wood have discussed these developments more extensively, especially the impact of the intellectual left's movement both into the academy and away from an intellectual and epistemic commitment to class struggle.4 Several features of that moment are pertinent for making sense of the subsequent development of antiracist politics in itself and the left's embrace of it. Disillusionment with democratic centralism and sclerotic bureaucratism fed a skeptical attitude toward organizational and intellectual discipline, as well as toward commitment to specific visions and programmes of social transformation. Those tendencies became exacerbated over the 1980s and 1990s as left activity retreated increasingly into universities. In that climate, as more and more of the left came to be defined by moral stance rather than strategic politics and practical programme, self-criticism and atonement regarding racism and sexism on the part of labour and the left in the past, and bearing witness against injustice in the present, loomed steadily larger as an element of left political discourse, especially in the US. And then, with rote repetition of ever more deeply embedded commonsense knowledge, the narrative of labour's and the left's past failings with respect to racial and gender inequalities was increasingly shed of nuance, to the point that in recent decades it has become a truism in some activist circles that failure to challenge ascriptive inequalities, or even active reproduction of them, has been a definitive characteristic of the working-class-based left and trade unions, and is substantially responsible for the decline of either or both.5 Commitment to the accusatory narrative can underwrite extraordinary historical misrepresentation, for example, Eugene Debs's statement that socialism has \u2018nothing special to offer the Negro' is taken as evidence of his indifference to racial inequality \u2013 when his intent was exactly the opposite.6 A left that had by and large given up the goal of radical social transformation and the objective of pursuing political power for the purpose of realizing that goal became less distinct from liberalism. Such a left, as Russell Jacoby notes, \u2018ineluctably retreats to smaller ideas, seeking to expand the options within the existing society'.7 Militant embrace of the discourses of identity politics, most notably antiracism, has helped to sustain an appearance that the left is not in retreat but remains on the cutting edge of transformational politics. That is because of the prominence of a view that construes \u2018oppressions' rooted in race and gender, etc., as both foundational to American society \u2013 or the West \u2013 and so deeply embedded that most whites/men are in denial about their power. From that perspective the civil rights movement's legislative victories in the 1960s were superficial and could not address the deep-structural sources of racism and sexism, which are effectively ontological and therefore beyond the reach of normal political or social intervention. Thus the struggle against these sources of inequality is always insurgent because their power never diminishes. CONTEMPORARY ANTIRACISM'S AHISTORICAL CHARACTER Representing racism as a transhistorical phenomenon, sometimes character- ized as a \u2018national disease' or \u2018original sin', underwrites a claim that it continues to shape life chances for blacks and other nonwhites as it did in earlier periods when, as W. E. B. Du Bois put it, \u2018the walls of race were clear and straight; when the world consisted of mutually exclusive races; and even though the exact edges might be blurred there was no question of exact definition and understanding of the meaning of the word', that is, when notions of racial hierarchy were hegemonic and were open and explicit principles of social and political organization.8 That view, to the extent that it understands racism as transcending patterns of historically specific social relations, presumes primordial understandings of race/racism as a phenomenon shared by both postwar racial liberalism and the earlier racial determinism it challenged. This is, moreover, a political problem as well as an intellectual one. The politics crafted in this antiracist framework has a rearguard character that is expressed in its proponents' tendency to rely on evocation of past racist practices \u2013 law professor Michelle Alexander's book The New Jim Crow is one prominent illustration9 \u2013 to mobilize outrage about injustices in the present. The argument by means of historical analogy, i.e., that current injustices that may seem to derive most directly from different, more complex sources are more significantly understood as like latter-day instances of racist practices in the past, rests on the trope that the current outrages demonstrate the deep continuity of racism as a force and at least suggests the inadequacy of the victories of the civil rights struggle. Yet that trope is also in effect an acknowledgment that big victories on that front have indeed been won. Otherwise there would be no basis for assuming that the comparison would have rhetorical force. Condemnation of an act or practice by comparing it to slavery or Jim Crow could provoke the desired effect only if we can assume consensus that slavery and Jim Crow were bad things. Moreover, sustaining the conviction that racism remains most significantly causal of contemporary patterns of inequality requires terminological gymnastics which enable positing racism \u2013 \u2018institutional', \u2018structural', even \u2018post-racial' \u2013 as, at least by default, the causal explanation for inequalities that appear statistically as racial disparity and are lived as such in day-to-day life. In fact, historical analogy typically stands in lieu of empirical argument to explain why we should automatically see contemporary disparities as evidence of the unspecified workings of a generic racism rather than as products of current and concrete political-economic processes that are very much \u2018presentist' elements of the regime of steadily intensifying regressive redistribution, the mechanisms, that is, that constitute the telos of neoliberalism. Assertion of the centrality of racist ideas and practices among labour and the left is similarly ahistorical both as a representation of the past and in its implications of continuity in the present. It is more allegory or fable than historical account. Presumptions, stances, and practices that now would be clearly recognized and negatively sanctioned as racist certainly were common enough in the Marxist left and the labour movement in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The appropriate basis of comparison \u2013 if one wants to make the sort of moral assessment that many critics of those institutions intend \u2013 would, however, not be early twenty-first century sensibilities, but whether racism and sexism were more prominent within unions and left politics than within other contemporaneous institutions. Frankly, from an historicist perspective this sort of exercise in moralistic calculation seems rather puerile, but, because antiracist criticisms of the left in the present depend so heavily on claims regarding the past, it is necessary to address them. Toward that end an important first step is recognizing that what race means and does not, how it has operated as a politically and ideologically potent category, as well as its meanings and significance, have evolved over time and context. The period of revolutionary ferment out of which the Bolshevik revolution emerged coincided with the historical moment when the race idea was at or approaching its apogee in the history of the world, before or since. At the beginning of the twentieth century race science identified between three and sixty-three \u2018basic' races in the world, including between three and six, or even thirty-six, in Europe alone.10 That ambiguity was the inevitable result of efforts to establish precise characteristics of a nonexistent phenomenon: \u2018races' simply do not exist as natural populations. Race theorists assumed that their efforts at taxonomic specification failed because generations of population movement and mixing had diluted original, \u2018pure' racial types; so they looked for racial essences beneath national or linguistic affiliations. This conviction in turn supported the manifestly unscientific approach of positing a priori ideal types and attempting to classify existing populations \u2018racially' by comparing the frequencies of geographical distribution of physical characteristics imputed to the ideal racial types constructed in the race scientists' taxonomies.11 Marxists and other leftists were more likely to dissent from hegemonic racialism than others, but race-thinking permeated political and intellectual discourse and everyday common sense. It was reproduced among progressives, Fabians and many socialist reformers, as well as conservatives, in dominant notions of evolution as progress. Teleological presumptions about fixed stages of cultural and social evolution and the comparative method in Victorian anthropology that considered contemporary \u2018primitives' as living versions of ancestral Europeans reinforced the tendency \u2013 convenient for proponents of colonial expansion \u2013 to rank populations hierarchically on the basis of natural limits and capacities ascribed to them. And even many revolutionaries believed that colonial domination was justified because \u2018backward' peoples needed periods of tutelage to prepare them for the modern world. Many English race scientists were convinced that the indigenous working class was racially different from the aristocracy. Just as some socialists opposed imperialist expansionism on egalitarian grounds, others opposed it on racial grounds, expressing fear of degeneration through contact with racially inferior populations.12 Often class struggle was fought at least partly on the terrain of racialist ideology. In the latter half of the nineteenth century fights in the American West over importation of Chinese labour and Japanese immigration also centred around racialist ideologies. Railroad operators and other importers of Chinese labour imagined and openly asserted that those workers' distinctive racial characteristics made them more tractable and able to live on less than white Americans; opponents, including the California labour movement, argued that those very racial characteristics would degrade American labour and that Chinese were racially \u2018unassimilable'. But it was the employer class, not the workers likely to be displaced or impoverished, who established the debate on racial terms. Post-bellum southern planters imported Chinese to the Mississippi Delta region to compete with black sharecroppers out of the same racialist presumptions of greater tractability, as did later importers of Sicilian labour to Louisiana sugarcane and cotton fields.13 Large-scale industrial production in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries depended on mass labour immigration mainly from the eastern and southern fringes of Europe. The innovations of race science \u2013 that is, of racialist folk ideology transformed into an academic profession \u2013 promised to assist employers' needs for rational labour force management and were present in the foundation of the fields of industrial relations and industrial psychology. Hugo Mu\u0308nsterberg, a founding luminary of industrial psychology, included \u2018race psychological diagnosis' as an element in assessment of employees' capabilities, although he stressed that racial or national temperaments are averages and considerable individual variation exists within groups. He argued that assessment, therefore, should be leavened with consideration of individuals' characteristics and that the influence of \u2018group psychology' would be significant \u2018only if the employment not of a single person, but of a large number, is in question, as it is most probable that the average character will show itself in a sufficient degree as soon as many members of the group are involved.'14 As scholarship on race science and its kissing cousin, eugenics, has shown, research that sets out to find evidence of racial difference will find it, whether or not it exists. Thus race science produced increasingly refined taxonomies of racial groups, and the apparent specificity of race theorists' just-so stories about differential racial capacities provided rationales for immigration restriction, sterilization, segregation and other regimes of inequality and subordination, including genocide. It also generated practical applications to assist employers in assigning workers to jobs for which they were racially suited. A \u2018racial adaptability' chart used by a Pittsburgh company in the 1920s mapped thirty-six different racial groups' capacities for twenty-two distinct jobs, eight different atmospheric conditions, jobs requiring speed or precision, and day or night shift work.15 Of course, all this was bogus, nothing more than narrow upper-class prejudices parading about as science. It was convincing only if one shared the folk narratives of essential hierarchy that the research assumed from the outset. But the race theories did not have to be true to be effective. They had only to be used as if they were true to produce the material effects that gave the ideology an authenticating verisimilitude. Poles became steel workers in Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Buffalo, Chicago, and Gary, not for any natural aptitude or affinity but because employers and labour recruiters sorted them into work in steel mills. RACIALIST IDEOLOGY'S MATERIAL FOUNDATIONS As a significant social force, racialist ideology has always been anchored to material imperatives, in both domestic and international domains. It became commonsense truth to the extent that it connected with the perspectives and interests of powerful elites. Like all ideologies of ascriptive difference, it would pre-empt debate over evolving programmes of exploitation and domination by reading them into nature. While the discourse of white supremacy certainly has had no shortage of sincere adherents, it became hegemonic over the second half of the nineteenth century because it comported well with upper-class prejudices and capitalists' economic programmes. That is how, as the Pittsburgh racial adaptability chart illustrates, it became the conceptual frame of reference within which other groups and strata came to understand their social position, articulate their own interests and thus constitute themselves practically as groups. In the US for instance, in the late 1830s and 1840s, in a context of rising abolitionist sentiment and the democratization of public discourse associated with the spread of universal (white male) suffrage, white supremacist ideology undergirded and propelled a shift in defences of slavery. Previously, pro-slavery arguments centred on defending the institution as a \u2018necessary evil', an unpleasant and even morally dubious requirement of the plantation- based economic order of the southern states. One antebellum planter put the matter succinctly: \u2018For what purpose does the master hold the servant? Is it not that by his labor, he, the master, may accumulate wealth?'16 In the changing political climate, the rhetorical centre of gravity of defences of slavery shifted to an argument that the institution was indeed a positive good for all involved, including the enslaved. This moment coincided with the formation of the embryo of what by the end of the century would become race science. As the sectional crisis sharpened in the late 1840s and early 1850s, propagation of white supremacist ideology \u2013 both rhetorically and institutionally, through carrots and sticks \u2013 became important as a basis for accommodating non-slaveholding southern whites to the possibility of secession. Appeals to racial solidarity provided a narrative of political cohesion and negatively sanctioned dissent. To be clear, indicating that it had a material foundation is not to suggest that embrace of white supremacy was \u2018purely' instrumental, even among proto-race scientists and pro-slavery ideologues. An important feature of ideologies of ascriptive difference is that they hopelessly cloud the distinction between principled belief and pursuit of self-interest. Josiah C. Nott and George R. Gliddon, the authors of Types of Mankind, one of the most prominent texts of mid-nineteenth century race theory, both no doubt believed sincerely that the races they identified were equivalent to separate species and that blacks were naturally fit for enslavement. They were also, respectively, a wealthy slave-owning Alabama physician and an English Egyptologist who also wrote on the cotton economy in Egypt.17 A striking testament to the harmonizing power of ideology is the appearance of an antebellum field of slave medicine, devoted to identification and treatment of conditions peculiar to blacks. Among those was drapetomania, a \u2018disease of the mind' that afflicted slaves with an irrational inclination to \u2018run away from service'. Samuel A. Cartwright, the slave-owning Louisiana physician who discovered and reported the malady in the early 1850s, when \u2018positive good' arguments had become dominant among slavery's defenders, was convinced that he had identified a genuine medical condition, preposterously transparent as it seems to a twenty-first century sensibility.18 White supremacist ideology, and the racialism in which it was embedded, operated similarly, of course, in relation to European and American colonialism in the late nineteenth century. Pioneer sociologist Edward A. Ross in 1901 laid out an especially clear account that links scientific race theory, rooted in the neo-Lamarckian evolutionism common in the early social sciences, and an argument for imperialism and colonization as inexorable imperatives of the \u2018vigorous' races.19 In an illustration of the complex ways that hegemonic racialism could work, Ross had been fired from the Stanford University faculty the year before for having run afoul of Jane Lathrop Stanford, widow of Leland Stanford of the Union Pacific railroad and domineering force on the University's board of trustees. Ross had earned Mrs Stanford's ire for two particular transgressions: he militantly advocated, in league with trade unions, intensified enforcement of Chinese exclusion on racial grounds (Union Pacific was a principal proponent of importing Chinese labour, also on racial grounds); and he advocated with equal militancy public ownership of utilities.20 Rudyard Kipling, a literal product of British imperialism, extolled \u2018The White Man's Burden', which \u2013 in a gush of enthusiasm at the US's recent acquisitions from the Spanish- Cuban-American War \u2013 he urged Americans to take up. I am agnostic with respect to how earnestly Kipling held the brew of condescension dressed as altruism projected in his infamous contention. We can say with certitude, though, that he understood that there was much more to colonialism than altruistic tutelage. In response to Kipling, one of the most emphatic racists of the day in American politics, Democratic US Senator from South Carolina Benjamin R. \u2018Pitchfork Ben' Tillman, denounced imperialist expansionism on racial grounds, stressing concerns that sustained contact with inferior populations would lead to white racial degeneration.21 By the turn of the twentieth century racialist ideology had become a global frame of reference through which arguments about colonialism and economic and political hierarchy were commonly conducted. Therefore, it should not be surprising that opposition to those hierarchies would be expressed, at least initially, in that same language. An oft-cited instance of that perception is W. E. B. Du Bois's 1903 observation that \u2018the problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the colour line', which he went on to specify as \u2018the re\tlation of the darker and lighter races of men in Asia and Africa and the islands of the sea'.22 In the US, mass disfranchisement of blacks and imposition of strictly codified white supremacist apartheid in nearly all the South made the colour line particularly salient as a bulwark against egalitarian political interests. This is consistent with how ascriptive ideologies naturalize contingent material relations of inequality by making them invisible within narratives of fixed hierarchy. The racialized discourse of tutelage, persistence of the presumptions of the Victorian comparative method, and direct and overt racialized domination all reinforced a similar understanding of the driving impetus of colonialism. It was reasonable for egalitarian opponents to assume either that racialist ideology was the proximate source of the inequality and exploitation, or that combating that ideology was a necessary precondition for attacking the inequality. It is noteworthy that both in the US and in much of the fin-de-sie\u0300cle colonial world, as Du Bois's colour line apothegm illustrates, the first tentative expressions of modern political assertiveness from the dominated populations were formulated within the paradigm of tutelage of the underdeveloped. The nascent professional and functionary classes in the colonies and the American South, the \u2018new men', as Judith Stein describes them, began to yield a stratum who pursued advocacy for subordinate populations alongside managerial authority over, and organized guidance of, their progress toward self-government. In the US that stratum of racial advocates, often describing themselves as \u2018race men' and \u2018race women', attained civic voice in the context of mass disfranchisement and shared a commitment to the large ideal of \u2018racial uplift'.23 This established a recognized social role and occupational niche for the race or ethnic group leader as a sort of freelance broker or ethnic-group entrepreneur. Booker T. Washington and Du Bois were prominent voices of this stratum. Both in the US and colonial territories this politics of group advocacy often rested on racialist presumptions about the subordinate populations' general backwardness and the stewardship role the group's more cultivated and advanced members should play in leading the masses out of their benighted state. This was a petition politics that addressed governing elites as its principal audience because it understood them to be the only source of e ective political agency. That meant as well that the mission of group uplift was defined within parameters set by the ruling class. By the 1930s racialist ideology was increasingly under attack on biological, anthropological, and political fronts, in part as an expression of the left's social momentum, which helped to buttress and disseminate egalitarian ideas and sensibilities. In that environment, the Great Migration from the Jim Crow South to big cities in the North and Midwest encouraged popular mass politics among black Americans, particularly as black workers were incorporated into the new industrial unionism. Mass organization as a political form as well as trade unionism also spread through much of the colonial world. In both settings, insurgent politics understandably joined opposition to racism with opposition to exploitation, as defences of those hierarchical regimes still depended on racialist arguments and would continue to do so for several decades. But the cultural and ideological victory of egalitarianism over racialism that consolidated in post-Second World War intellectual life came with a very large asterisk. What was largely defeated was the historically specific strict bio-determinist discourse of race that had prevailed as common sense between the last decades of the nineteenth century and the first quarter of the twentieth. Walter Benn Michaels and Werner Sollors have shown that the retreat from race to culture in theories of social di erence that began in the 1920s was in some ways more an exchange of one metaphor of essential di erence for another than a rejection of the notion of essential group di erence. As historian of anthropology George Stocking, Jr points out, from its origins in the early twentieth century the modern culture idea never fully escaped race theory's presumptions.24 In the postwar years, culture increasingly supplanted race in discourses legitimating inequality, particularly regarding exploitation of colonized societies and racial minorities in the US. In its taxonomy of \u2018stages of development', modernization theory in the academic study of comparative political development merely rehearsed hoary racialist accounts, such as that by E. A. Ross cited above, and the logic of the Victorian comparative method, while dressing them in a later generation's scientistic raiment. Robert Vitalis has shown recently how the academic field and political practice of international politics in the US remained rooted in substantively racialist paradigms well into the 1960s.25 And the State Department's and other national elites' concerns about the impact that domestic civil rights agitation could have on US imperial designs in former colonial territories led to a concern with damage control that generated, on the one hand, censorship of news broadcast abroad and intense monitoring and policing of domestic activists' overseas engagements and, on the other, liberal Cold Warriors' pressure on the domestic front in support of some versions of the movement's aims.26 AMBIGUITIES OF RACE AND CLASS IN POSTWAR INSURGENCIES Anti-colonial and national liberation movements also paid attention and to some extent drew inspiration from the postwar black American insurgency and vice versa. At least through the 1950s, movements on both planes of insurgency mobilized in general terms on a popular front basis. In both spheres \u2013 economic position and racial or national category \u2013 each signified the other. In the black American case, the postwar insurgency, which had germinated since the mid-1930s, incubated by industrial unionism and socialist agitation, was propelled partly by a tension between what Preston Smith characterizes as racial democratic (i.e., committed to radical equality of opportunity within American capitalism) and social democratic tendencies and programmes.27 Occasionally, the ultimate contradiction between those tendencies would erupt as open conflict around specific initiatives. However, in quotidian experience racial discrimination and subordination and economic exploitation and degradation seemed, and on one level were, elements in a singular system of oppression. For leftists in both loci of insurgency, pursuit of redistribution along racial and class lines each seemed to be a necessary condition for successful pursuit of the other, if they were not treated as indistinguishable. By the end of the Second World War, even very conventional black liberals and moderates were emphatic that continued growth of industrial unionism and expansion of public social wage policies were indispensable for black Americans' advancement toward equality.28 For many, including activists, the social-democratic and racial-democratic imperatives were so tightly melded that, even on those occasions when tension between them erupted into explicit conflict in relation to specific initiatives, the sources of conflict typically were interpreted as deriving from individual, idiosyncratic di erences rather than more portentous ideological contradiction. A downside of the popular front style of politics, which was very successful through the major legislative victories of the mid-1960s, was that it proceeded from an abstract commitment to the interests of the race as a whole as a governing norm for political judgment, which was by definition murky and facilitated evasion of those sharp, potentially zero-sum disagreements over political vision that would surface in strategic or even tactical debates. This murkiness left many popular front black radicals ill- prepared for a critical moment in the mid-1960s when the submerged class contradiction sharpened in debate over ways forward after the legislative victories against segregation. THE CLASS CONTRADICTION That tension in black politics was at its core a class contradiction; racial democracy is the social ideal of the aspiring professional-managerial and business strata. Failure, inability or reluctance to address class dynamics in black politics as such, while understandable in the context of dynamic racial popular front insurgency as a strategic desideratum or even simple oversight, nonetheless has had consequences for subsequent understandings of the relation of race and politics and assertions of the scope of authentically black political interests that eventually undermined possibilities for sustaining a working-class agenda in black politics. Antagonistic reactions from both antiracist activists and political elites to Senator Bernie Sanders's campaign for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, on a platform inspired by social democracy, threw into bold relief the extent to which what is now generally recognized as black politics is fundamentally a professional- managerial class programme that constitutes the left-wing of neoliberalism. This politics actively invokes the cultural authority of earlier moments of black insurgency, shorn of their working-class programmatic character, and spectres of the racial order it opposed, to align with a neoliberal ideal of social justice \u2013 parity in the distribution of capitalism's costs and benefits among recognized ascriptive categories \u2013 as the boundary of the politically thinkable, even among a nominal left. This odd state of affairs is the product of several developments in postwar American politics, beginning with the impact of the business counterattack on labour in the years after the war and the aggressive anti-communism of the late 1940s and 1950s, and including the terms on which the victories of the mid-1960s were consolidated institutionally within black politics and the country at large. And, perhaps counter-intuitively, identification with Third World anti-colonial and national liberation movements in the 1960s and 1970s played a significant role in rendering invisible the class dynamics that shaped the thrust and impact of post-segregation black politics. The decade after the end of the Second World War was a key moment in helping form the trajectory that has culminated in contemporary antiracist politics in the US. Two linked pressures, one suppressive and the other affirmative, shifted the balance in black popular front radicalism sharply in favour of the racial-democratic tendency. The reactionary anti- communist offensive of those years, as was its domestic intent, stigmatized and suppressed expressions of socialist or anti-capitalist politics or critique. Its effects on accelerating purges of the left from the labour movement are well known. Leah N. Gordon and Risa Golubo have examined its impact on the strategic orientation of black politics and racial advocacy.29 Crucially, aggressive, putschist anti-communism and its \u2018loyalty' apparatus drove a retreat from political-economic interpretations of the bases of racial inequality and toward an individualist, psychologistic perspective focused on racism as prejudice, bigotry, or intolerance. On the affirmative side of the ledger, that new racial liberalism divorced from political economy encouraged a litigation strategy of challenging the codified apartheid in the South as violating the guarantees of equal protection against discriminatory state action provided by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. By the mid-1940s the federal courts had shown that that direction could produce positive results for litigants, and that potential opening impelled a focus on the segregationist southern order and its infringements on the civil rights of blacks as a class of individuals. Of course, segregation violated the Fourteenth Amendment no more in 1954, when the US Supreme Court found state-sponsored racially segregated education unconstitutional by definition, than it had in 1896, when the Court's ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson upheld codified segregation in the \u2018separate but equal' doctrine. Moreover, black activists had fought against the segregationist regime with whatever means available since before Plessy had established it as legitimate. What had changed was the political and cultural centre of gravity with regard to racial inequality and discrimination. To be sure, the social-democratic tendency in black politics did not disappear. It remained an important engine of popular political action through the 1960s. The fabled 1963 March on Washington was organized principally by labour leader A. Philip Randolph's Negro American Labor Council, and was officially called the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, organized and carried out with considerable trade union support. The impetus for the protest in Memphis at which Martin Luther King, Jr was assassinated was a sanitation workers' strike that was an outcropping of a regional organizing campaign of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME). Labour and class-related issues were central to much of the militant action that made up the high period of southern civil rights activism from the 1940s through the 1960s, as well as a two-decade long struggle \u2013 mainly outside the South, where ruling-class dominance was too complete \u2013 for local, state, and federal Fair Employment Practices legislation. This would extend beyond anti-discrimination efforts to authorize public intervention in labour markets to pursue full employment, which had been a central goal of black political agitation \u2013 and the black-labour-left alliance in which it was embedded \u2013 since the war years. Even in the South, however, as the Memphis case illustrates, labour and class issues were often as not high on the movement's agenda. Even such proceduralist liberal staples of the anti-segregation struggle as restoration of voting rights were linked in the minds of activists and rank-and-file movement supporters to working-class and labour objectives. NATIONAL LIBERATION, BLACK POWER AND CLASS POLITICS As Cold War liberalism and postwar racial liberalism converged, activists increasingly tended to link the civil rights agenda to the Cold War international agenda, especially regarding the decolonizing Third World, characterizing southern segregationists as out of step with world opinion and harmful to national security. Thus, at the same time as politically attentive black Americans drew inspiration from and inspired decolonization and national liberation movements abroad, many also found it at least instrumentally useful to identify their domestic struggles with US international aspirations. Not many perceived that there was a possible contradiction between those positions. Black Americans' identification with anti-colonial struggles rested on an almost unavoidable and a ectively powerful sense of common, or at least comparable condition. I recall, on first seeing the film soon after its release, finding the \u2018Battle of Algiers' immensely resonant; it seemed that I had lived some of it as a child and adolescent in New Orleans and other American cities. But that general identification was also in important ways superficial and nai\u0308ve, and it would eventually become implicated in the critical defeat of the social-democratic tendency in black politics in the late 1960s and 1970s. Black American Third Worldism was more nationalist than revolutionary. Going back to Du Bois's apothegm about the colour line \u2013 and it is much less known that he essentially recanted it by the early 1950s, specifically describing race as an \u2018excuse' in class war30 \u2013 black identification with colonized populations stemmed partly from an idealized racial nationalism that presumed white supremacist constructions of the stakes of western imperialism. Du Bois's 1928 novel Dark Princess is a romance based on the premise of a global rising of united peoples of colour.31 In the 1930s and even into the war, many black Americans cheered on Japanese imperialism as a non-white challenge to white supremacy.32 The roots of the characterization of black Americans' position as an instance of \u2018domestic colonialism' in the early 1960s lay in an e ort not merely to elevate the black insurgency's power and significance through association with Third World struggles, but also to advocate a model of national liberation as a programme and approach for black politics in the US.33 Third Worldism was in general more a rhetorical phenomenon than a substantively programmatic one. Marxist revolutionaries on the capitalist periphery embraced it as an aspiration. Mao propounded a \u2018three worlds' theory, and Cuba still maintains the Organizacio\u0301n de Solidaridad con los Pueblos de Asia, A\u0301frica, y Ame\u0301rica Latina (OSPAAL). Left governments in Venezuela and elsewhere have drawn on imagery at least evocative of Third Worldism and Non-Alignment in their e orts to organize regional and supra-regional (typically based on common export commodities) economic and political blocs. The Alianza Bolivariana para los Pueblos de Nuestra Ame\u0301rica (ALBA), with member states in South America, Central America, and the Caribbean, is arguably the most extensive and successful of those e orts. For the most part, however, the history of Third Worldism and the Non-Aligned Movement as predicated on the goal of global alliance of \u2018peoples of colour' \u2013 anti-imperialist or otherwise \u2013 has been very much oversold.34 Moreover, the view that non-whiteness provides a basis for transnational political alliance simply rehearses the mystification that colonialism had been driven fundamentally by white supremacist ideology. As Fanon observed early in the period of decolonization, that mystification, in identifying racial transfer of formal authority as the essence of national liberation, also obscured the extent to which imperialism was always first and foremost a class project, of which colonialism buttressed by racialist fables was only one historically specific form. In any event, as anti-colonial and national liberation struggles intensified in the 1960s against the backdrop of the escalating Indochina War, Western leftists, almost as a reflex, generally supported those insurgent movements and defended them against inegalitarian critics and imperialist state power; doing so was consistent with the left's egalitarian and democratic values. Many of those movements contained different ideological and class tendencies, a complexity often obscured by their populist rhetoric, which posited claims to represent the authentic \u2018people'. How class dynamics played out in national liberation movements that succeeded in winning independence and official self-determination is well known. Even several of those movements that embraced socialism and attempted to link the national liberation struggle to a popular class politics \u2013 e.g., the FLN in Algeria, the African National Congress in South Africa and those that came to power in the former Portuguese colonies in Africa \u2013 were ultimately incorporated into the logic of capitalist globalization in ways that articulated with domestic class contradictions.35 In the US, escalation of the war on Vietnam encouraged greater attentiveness in the left to imperialist interventionism, and over that decade armed national liberation or revolutionary struggles intensified in much of the former colonial world and Latin America. At the same time the Black Power nationalist embrace of the domestic colonial analogy and the discourse of national liberation gave a radical halo to what was, militant rhetorical flourishes aside, programmatically an ethnic politics fully incorporable with the pluralist interest-group system. Notwithstanding the sincere convictions of adherents, Black Power was, consistent with ethnic politics in general, very much a class-based affair, harnessing an abstract and symbolic racial populism to an agenda that centred concretely on advancing the interests and aspirations of new political and entrepreneurial strata which emerged from the victories of the civil rights movement and demographic racial transition in American cities.36 In relation to a history of racial exclusion, it was reasonable and appropriate that many leftists supported what was substantively a programme for inclusion on a racial-democratic model. And the rhetorical militancy and racial-populist symbolism associated with Black Power, including the tropes of national liberation, reinforced the sense that it was a radical or revolutionary tendency that leftists should support. For more than half a century that view of Black Power has obscured the significance of the mid-1960s debate in black politics over the movement's direction in the wake of the legislative victories. On one side, a working- class and labour-based black radicalism, propounded principally by A. Philip Randolph and his associate and longtime civil rights activist Bayard Rustin, argued that the struggle for black equality faced new, larger challenges opened by the defeat of Jim Crow that required building a different sort of movement centred on the familiar black-liberal-labour-left alliance. In questioning whether \u2018civil rights movement' even remained an accurate description, Rustin argued, in a widely read essay published a year before Stokely Carmichael introduced the Black Power slogan to the world, that the next phase of the struggle called for expanding the movement's vision \u2018beyond race relations to economic relations'. He argued that it could not succeed \u2018in the absence of radical programs for full employment, abolition of slums, the reconstruction of our educational system, new definitions of work and leisure. Adding up the cost of such programs, we can only conclude that we are talking about a refashioning of our political economy.' For that reason, he contended: \u2018The future of the Negro struggle depends on whether the contradictions of this society can be resolved by a coalition of progressive forces which becomes the effective political majority in the United States. I speak of the coalition which staged the March on Washington, passed the Civil Rights Act, and laid the basis for the Johnson landslide \u2013 Negroes, trade unionists, liberals, and religious groups.'37 This was an unambiguous assertion of the social-democratic tendency in black politics, which Randolph and Rustin followed up with introduction of a \u2018Freedom Budget' that laid out an agenda for realizing a full-employment economy and its benefits for the society as a whole, noting that black Americans' circumstances would be improved disproportionately if the Budget were implemented.38 For a variety of structural and idiosyncratic reasons, their call did not gain social traction.39 Contributing to its defeat was that the racial-democratic tendency aligned more comfortably with new institutional opportunities made available by the Voting Rights Act, racial transition in cities, anti-discrimination enforcement and the War on Poverty, all of which constituted a class-based racial redistribution that comported with the material aspirations of the emerging, post-segregation black professional-managerial class.40 Incipient Black Power racial populism obscured the class character of those developments. Particularly ironic, in light of the subsequent development of black politics, is that many radicals successfully deployed racial populism, reinforced by allusions to anti-colonial and national liberation struggles, to portray the social-democratic approach advocated by Randolph and Rustin as a conservative \u2018integrationist' call for subordination to white interests. Because black radicals never had the political capacity to challenge for state power or a broad and deep popular base, the movement's class tensions seldom surfaced in political debate. By the mid-1960s the racial-democratic tendency's cultural force and institutional clout \u2013 including its incorporation within postwar liberalism \u2013 had made its commitment to racial redistribution practically hegemonic as the standard of justice and equality for black Americans. In retrospect, that moment marked the birth of antiracism as a claim to a discrete politics. The ambiguity and murkiness in black popular front radicalism regarding intra-racial class dynamics undercut the ability of social-democratic advocates to mount appropriate critical responses. For the most part, such advocates also fell back on a discourse of racial authenticity and objections that the strategies and objectives of the emerging political class did not properly represent the interests of the \u2018community' or the \u2018people'. The conceptual limitations imposed by that fetishized racial populism testified to and reinforced professional-managerial class hegemony in black politics. Partly from ideological purblindness, partly from material imperatives, the expressions of political radicalism that purported to dissent from the consolidating new black class politics \u2013 openly idealist cultural nationalism, a new, anti-imperialist Pan-Africanism, and a potted Marxism-Leninism \u2013 defined their radicalism through withdrawal from mundane political dynamics and embrace of one or another flavour of millenarian revolutionary catechism.41 Some black radicals, particularly in the 1970s moment of the largely Maoist New Communist movement in the US, strove to meld their fundamentally nationalist discourse of national liberation with a Marxist anti-imperialism. The Black Panther Party had been an early expression of this inclination.42 However, that turn retained the crucial assumptions of national liberation discourse, especially the most significant one \u2013 the nationalist premise that posits the group as an authentically communitarian and singular \u2018people' united against external oppression, and represents the character of class struggle within the population (e.g., black Americans) as that \u2018people' arrayed against inauthentic \u2018misleaders' or a co-opted, comprador element. That view originated in the \u2018domestic colonialism' analogy that emerged from some radicals' early 1960s identification with Third World insurgencies. The great irony of this apparently radical tendency is that the communitarian populism on which it rested worked mainly to obscure class dynamics within black politics. It is a marker of retreat from programmatic commitment to social transformation that many who consider themselves on the left accept the stance that racial politics is more radical or inclusive than class politics and that pursuit of socialism is suspect on identitarian grounds. Ascriptive identity becomes the primary basis for political commitment, and solidarity on the basis of who we are trumps solidarity on the basis of what we believe only when the left no longer has a transformative vision around which to cohere as a basis for political judgment. Antiracism does not have an affirmative agenda, a fact that complements a left that by and large has little clarity of social vision itself. Antiracist politics mimes radicalism with posture and performative evocation of earlier insurgent politics like Black Power radicalism in the US and the national liberation movements of the 1960s and 1970s, but with complete erasure of the class and political-economic tensions in which those movements were immersed. CONCLUSION Positing a singular black community or racial political aspiration has had long- reaching effects on black politics, and leftist scholarship on black Americans, that have facilitated accommodation to neoliberal imperatives often while intending quite the opposite. Proliferation of a literature that presumes a singular \u2018black freedom movement', \u2018black liberation movement' or even a \u2018long civil rights movement' divests black Americans' political activity of its tensions and structural contradictions. The effect is to de-historicize examination of black politics. Politically, this tendency has obscured thirty years or more of steadily lowered expectations for what can be gained from political action. This was exemplified clearly during the 2016 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination when in South Carolina, longtime Georgia Congressman and former civil rights movement icon John Lewis and his fellow black Congressman James Clyburn from South Carolina denounced the Sanders campaign's proposal for free public higher education as irresponsible because it sent the bad message that people should expect free things \u2013 that is, decommodified public goods and services \u2013 from government. \u2018Nothing is free in America', Lewis snarled.43 Left-neoliberal exuberance surrounding the Democratic National Convention's official nomination of Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate made undeniably clear that antiracism and other identitarian expressions are more than simply compatible with neoliberalism but are most meaningfully active components of its ideological reproduction. Dara Lind, writing in vox.com, exulted that \u2018a commitment to diversity has become the [Democratic] party's unifying principle', and Jeet Heer gushed in The New Republic that \u2018the Democratic Party opened their arms to Republicans \u2013 without compromising their liberal values'.44 Identity and social liberalism in this happy vision will completely override the Democrats' enduring class loyalties, and contradictions. There are two final ironies to note regarding the left embrace of antiracist politics. First, all politics in a class society is class politics. Antiracism is not exempt from that reality. What its proponents will not admit is that it is a class politics but not a working-class politics. Second, representing race as a primordial identity also elevates it as a social force above the dynamics of the reproduction of capitalist social relations; in that sense, antiracist politics of the contemporary sort proceeds from the same primordialist view of race as did fin-de-sie\u0300cle race theorists. And that is also a case of argument by historical analogy coming home to roost.'"

In other words, the relationship between the resistive subject and ideology is not one of false consciousness, but one of cynicism: we are not misdirected by shallow spectacles, but instead somehow distracted by our cynical belief that we are being \u201cdistracted\u201d. In this section, I begin by outlining the concept of cynicism as it has been theorised by Peter Sloterdijk and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek. This then leads us to an analysis of the cynical position adopted by Brand's critics, which I argue actually demonstrates more political problems on the part of the left than those suggested by Brand himself.\u00b6 For Sloterdijk, cynicism is an attitude that emerges right at the centre of the enlightenment project, where, in contrast to a modernist illumination of truth, \u201ca twilight arises, a deep ambivalence\u201d (1987, p. 22). Rather than the promised heightened consciousness of science that would allow us to see the hidden essential truths behind appearances, the very conception of truth as unconcealedness (aletheia)3 instead creates a widespread mistrust and suspicion of every appearance. Subsequently, \u201ca new form of realism bursts forth, a form that is driven by the fear of becoming deceived or overpowered \u2026 everything that appears to us could be a deceptive manoeuvre of an overpowering evil enemy\u201d (Sloterdijk, 1987, p. 330). The surface becomes suspect and the subject therefore retreats from all appearances: judging them to be spectacles that are seeking to oppress through falsity. The result is cynicism.\u00b6 Subsequently, this leads Sloterdijk to his well-known paradoxical definition of cynicism as \u201cenlightened false consciousness\u201d which he describes as a \u201cmodernized, unhappy consciousness on which enlightenment has laboured both successfully and in vain \u2026 it has learned its lessons in enlightenment, but it has not, probably was not able to, put them into practice\u201d (1987, p. 5). In other words, in the search for a higher consciousness behind appearances, the subject is paradoxically \u201cduped\u201d by their very suspicion of being duped. Furthermore, because the subject thinks they \u201cknow\u201d that appearances are just a mask, they disbelieve the truth when it does appear. Like the story of the Emperor's New Clothes, they fancy themselves to know what is right in front of their eyes (that the emperor is nude and vulnerable) yet they choose \u201cnot to know\u201d and don't act upon it (they still act as if the emperor is all-powerful). As such,\u00b6 cynical reason is no longer na\u00efve, but is a paradox of enlightened false consciousness: one knows the falsehood very well, one is well aware of a particular hidden interest hidden behind the ideological universality, but still one does not renounce it. (\u017di\u017eek, 1989, p. 23)\u00b6 The audience to the parade of power can see that the emperor is not divine \u2013 just a fragile human body like the rest of us \u2013 yet they cynically choose not to know and objectively retain his aura. They congratulate themselves on \u201cknowing\u201d that Brand is a trivial spectacle, yet they choose to remain apathetic towards his calls for action.\u00b6 As such, the dismissive reaction to Brand reveals a regressive interpassive tendency of the left to subjectively treat ourselves as \u201cenlightened\u201d to authentic politics and yet objectively render ourselves passive. In a kind of defence mechanism, the left believes that it\u00b6 can avoid becoming the dupe of the latest fashion or advertising trend by treating everything as a matter of fashion and advertising, reassuring ourselves as we flip through television channels or browse through the shopping mall that at least we know what's really going on. (Stanley, 2007, p. 399)\u00b6 The critics disbelieve Brand, distrusting his motives and seeing him as inauthentic, yet they continue to \u201cbelieve\u201d objectively in their own marginalisation. As such, the cynical left believe they are dismissing shallow spectacle in the direction of a stronger authentic radicalism, yet what their \u201cdoing believes\u201d is the maintenance of their apathetic position. More precisely, it maintains the attitudes of left melancholy and anti-populism.\u00b6 The problem of \u201cleft melancholy\u201d points towards the forever-delayed search for authenticity on the part of a cynical left that is in mourning. Coined by Walter Benjamin (1998), the concept points towards \u201cthe revolutionary who is, finally, attached more to a particular political analysis or ideal \u2013 even to the failure of that ideal \u2013 than to seizing possibilities for radical change in the present\u201d (Brown, 1999, p. 19). Suffering from a history of defeat and embarrassment, the left persist in a narcissistic identification with failure, fetishising the \u201cgood old days\u201d and remaining faithful to lost causes. As Benjamin himself points out, the cynical kernel of this attitude is clear, as \u201cmelancholy betrays the world for the sake of knowledge \u2026 but in its tenacious self-absorption it embraces dead objects in its consumption in order to redeem them\u201d (1998, p. 157). In other words, the sentiment is a deliberate self-sabotage that takes place even before politics proper has a chance to begin or \u201cthe paradox of an intention to mourn that precedes and anticipates the loss of the object\u201d (\u017di\u017eek, 2001, p. 146).\u00b6 This then leads us to the second problem of leftist cynicism: anti-populism. As a result of melancholia, the left has developed the bad habit of prejudging all instances of popular radical expression (such as Brand's) as necessarily flawed. However, to return to Dean again, she points out that this aversion to being popular and successful is a defining feature of a contemporary left, who prefer to adopt an \u201cauthentic\u201d underdog position in advance than take risks towards political power. As she argues, \u201cwe\u201d on the left see \u201courselves\u201d as \u201calways morally correct but never politically responsible\u201d (Dean, 2009, p. 6) prepositioned as righteous victims and proud political losers from the outset. What this cynicism towards instances of popular radicalism ultimately means, therefore, is that any concern for authenticity is ultimately a regressive one, a defence mechanism for a left that \u201cas long as it sees itself as defeated victims, can refrain from having to admit is short on ideas\u201d (Dean, 2009, p. 5). Such an attitude means never risking potential failure and residing in the safety of marginal righteousness.\u00b6 It is the contention here, therefore, that both melancholia and anti-populism can be seen in the cynical reaction to Brand's radicalism. Somewhat ironically, Brand (2013) even recognised these problems himself when he wrote in his New Statesman piece that\u00b6 the right seeks converts while the left seeks traitors \u2026 this moral superiority that is peculiar to the left is a great impediment towards momentum \u2026 for an ideology that is defined by inclusiveness, socialism has become in practice quite exclusive.\u00b6 Automatically, then, the left denounce Brand and self-proclaimed \u201cradical left-wing thinkers and organisers\u201d bitterly complain how he is getting so much attention for the arguments they have been making for years (for example, Park & Nastasia, 2013). The left maintain distance and label Brand trivial, yet such a distance only renders these critiques even more marginal and prevents them from becoming popular, effective or counter-hegemonic.\u00b6 As \u017di\u017eek has pointed out, the political issue of cynicism is \u201cnot that people \u2018do not know what they want' but rather that cynical resignation prevents them from acting upon it, with the result that a weird gap opens up between what people think and how they act\u201d, adding that \u201ctoday's post-political silent majority is not stupid, but it is cynical and resigned\u201d (2011, p. 390). In terms of Brand, this blanket cynical melancholy is typical of the left's distrust of anything popular, rendering them \u201clike the last men\u201d whose \u201cimmediate reaction to idealism is mocking cynicism\u201d (Winlow & Hall, 2012, p. 13). Proponents of a radical alternative immediately adopt caution with the effect of forever delaying change, holding out for that real and authentic (unbranded) struggle and therefore denying it indefinitely.'"

    "target_text": "Corrected Card: tag: 'Their basic frame for politics reconfirms the failures of the Left, turning debate into a Vampires' Castle where the propagation of guilt and cycles of pseudo-activity overcome meaningful theorizing and political change' | cite: 'Fisher 13 (Mark Fisher, commissioning editor at Zer0 Books, programme Leader of the MA in Aural and Visual Cultures at Goldsmiths, University of London, lecturer at the University of East London, \u201cExiting the Vampire Castle,\u201d The North Star, November 22, 2013)' | contents: 'Inside the Vampires' Castle The first configuration is what I came to call the Vampires' Castle. The Vampires' Castle specialises in propagating guilt. It is driven by a priest's desire to excommunicate and condemn, an academic-pedant's desire to be the first to be seen to spot a mistake, and a hipster's desire to be one of the in-crowd. The danger in attacking the Vampires' Castle is that it can look as if \u2013 and it will do everything it can to reinforce this thought \u2013 that one is also attacking the struggles against racism, sexism, heterosexism. But, far from being the only legitimate expression of such struggles, the Vampires' Castle is best understood as a bourgeois-liberal perversion and appropriation of the energy of these movements. The Vampires' Castle was born the moment when the struggle not to be defined by identitarian categories became the quest to have \u2018identities' recognised by a bourgeois big Other. The privilege I certainly enjoy as a white male consists in part in my not being aware of my ethnicity and my gender, and it is a sobering and revelatory experience to occasionally be made aware of these blind-spots. But, rather than seeking a world in which everyone achieves freedom from identitarian classification, the Vampires' Castle seeks to corral people back into identi-camps, where they are forever defined in the terms set by dominant power, crippled by self-consciousness and isolated by a logic of solipsism which insists that we cannot understand one another unless we belong to the same identity group. I've noticed a fascinating magical inversion projection-disavowal mechanism whereby the sheer mention of class is now automatically treated as if that means one is trying to downgrade the importance of race and gender. In fact, the exact opposite is the case, as the Vampires' Castle uses an ultimately liberal understanding of race and gender to obfuscate class. In all of the absurd and traumatic twitterstorms about privilege earlier this year it was noticeable that the discussion of class privilege was entirely absent. The task, as ever, remains the articulation of class, gender and race \u2013 but the founding move of the Vampires' Castle is the dis-articulation of class from other categories. The problem that the Vampires' Castle was set up to solve is this: how do you hold immense wealth and power while also appearing as a victim, marginal and oppositional? The solution was already there \u2013 in the Christian Church. So the VC has recourse to all the infernal strategies, dark pathologies and psychological torture instruments Christianity invented, and which Nietzsche described in The Genealogy of Morals. This priesthood of bad conscience, this nest of pious guilt-mongers, is exactly what Nietzsche predicted when he said that something worse than Christianity was already on the way. Now, here it is \u2026 The Vampires' Castle feeds on the energy and anxieties and vulnerabilities of young students, but most of all it lives by converting the suffering of particular groups \u2013 the more \u2018marginal' the better \u2013 into academic capital. The most lauded figures in the Vampires' Castle are those who have spotted a new market in suffering \u2013 those who can find a group more oppressed and subjugated than any previously exploited will find themselves promoted through the ranks very quickly. The first law of the Vampires' Castle is: individualise and privatise everything. While in theory it claims to be in favour of structural critique, in practice it never focuses on anything except individual behaviour. Some of these working class types are not terribly well brought up, and can be very rude at times. Remember: condemning individuals is always more important than paying attention to impersonal structures. The actual ruling class propagates ideologies of individualism, while tending to act as a class. (Many of what we call \u2018conspiracies' are the ruling class showing class solidarity.) The VC, as dupe-servants of the ruling class, does the opposite: it pays lip service to \u2018solidarity' and \u2018collectivity', while always acting as if the individualist categories imposed by power really hold. Because they are petit-bourgeois to the core, the members of the Vampires' Castle are intensely competitive, but this is repressed in the passive aggressive manner typical of the bourgeoisie. What holds them together is not solidarity, but mutual fear \u2013 the fear that they will be the next one to be outed, exposed, condemned. The second law of the Vampires' Castle is: make thought and action appear very, very difficult. There must be no lightness, and certainly no humour. Humour isn't serious, by definition, right? Thought is hard work, for people with posh voices and furrowed brows. Where there is confidence, introduce scepticism. Say: don't be hasty, we have to think more deeply about this. Remember: having convictions is oppressive, and might lead to gulags. The third law of the Vampires' Castle is: propagate as much guilt as you can. The more guilt the better. People must feel bad: it is a sign that they understand the gravity of things. It's OK to be class-privileged if you feel guilty about privilege and make others in a subordinate class position to you feel guilty too. You do some good works for the poor, too, right? The fourth law of the Vampires' Castle is: essentialize. While fluidity of identity, pluarity and multiplicity are always claimed on behalf of the VC members \u2013 partly to cover up their own invariably wealthy, privileged or bourgeois-assimilationist background \u2013 the enemy is always to be essentialized. Since the desires animating the VC are in large part priests' desires to excommunicate and condemn, there has to be a strong distinction between Good and Evil, with the latter essentialized. Notice the tactics. X has made a remark/ has behaved in a particular way \u2013 these remarks/ this behaviour might be construed as transphobic/ sexist etc. So far, OK. But it's the next move which is the kicker. X then becomes defined as a transphobe/ sexist etc. Their whole identity becomes defined by one ill-judged remark or behavioural slip. Once the VC has mustered its witch-hunt, the victim (often from a working class background, and not schooled in the passive aggressive etiquette of the bourgeoisie) can reliably be goaded into losing their temper, further securing their position as pariah/ latest to be consumed in feeding frenzy. The fifth law of the Vampires' Castle: think like a liberal (because you are one). The VC's work of constantly stoking up reactive outrage consists of endlessly pointing out the screamingly obvious: capital behaves like capital (it's not very nice!), repressive state apparatuses are repressive. We must protest! Neo-anarchy in the UK The second libidinal formation is neo-anarchism. By neo-anarchists I definitely do not mean anarchists or syndicalists involved in actual workplace organisation, such as the Solidarity Federation. I mean, rather, those who identify as anarchists but whose involvement in politics extends little beyond student protests and occupations, and commenting on Twitter. Like the denizens of the Vampires' Castle, neo-anarchists usually come from a petit-bourgeois background, if not from somewhere even more class-privileged. They are also overwhelmingly young: in their twenties or at most their early thirties, and what informs the neo-anarchist position is a narrow historical horizon. Neo-anarchists have experienced nothing but capitalist realism. By the time the neo-anarchists had come to political consciousness \u2013 and many of them have come to political consciousness remarkably recently, given the level of bullish swagger they sometimes display \u2013 the Labour Party had become a Blairite shell, implementing neo-liberalism with a small dose of social justice on the side. But the problem with neo-anarchism is that it unthinkingly reflects this historical moment rather than offering any escape from it. It forgets, or perhaps is genuinely unaware of, the Labour Party's role in nationalising major industries and utilities or founding the National Health Service. Neo-anarchists will assert that \u2018parliamentary politics never changed anything', or the \u2018Labour Party was always useless' while attending protests about the NHS, or retweeting complaints about the dismantling of what remains of the welfare state. There's a strange implicit rule here: it's OK to protest against what parliament has done, but it's not alright to enter into parliament or the mass media to attempt to engineer change from there. Mainstream media is to be disdained, but BBC Question Time is to be watched and moaned about on Twitter. Purism shades into fatalism; better not to be in any way tainted by the corruption of the mainstream, better to uselessly \u2018resist' than to risk getting your hands dirty. It's not surprising, then, that so many neo-anarchists come across as depressed. This depression is no doubt reinforced by the anxieties of postgraduate life, since, like the Vampires' Castle, neo-anarchism has its natural home in universities, and is usually propagated by those studying for postgraduate qualifications, or those who have recently graduated from such study. What is to be done? Why have these two configurations come to the fore? The first reason is that they have been allowed to prosper by capital because they serve its interests. Capital subdued the organised working class by decomposing class consciousness, viciously subjugating trade unions while seducing \u2018hard working families' into identifying with their own narrowly defined interests instead of the interests of the wider class; but why would capital be concerned about a \u2018left' that replaces class politics with a moralising individualism, and that, far from building solidarity, spreads fear and insecurity? The second reason is what Jodi Dean has called communicative capitalism. It might have been possible to ignore the Vampires' Castle and the neo-anarchists if it weren't for capitalist cyberspace. The VC's pious moralising has been a feature of a certain \u2018left' for many years \u2013 but, if one wasn't a member of this particular church, its sermons could be avoided. Social media means that this is no longer the case, and there is little protection from the psychic pathologies propagated by these discourses. So what can we do now? First of all, it is imperative to reject identitarianism, and to recognise that there are no identities, only desires, interests and identifications. Part of the importance of the British Cultural Studies project \u2013 as revealed so powerfully and so movingly in John Akomfrah's installation The Unfinished Conversation (currently in Tate Britain) and his film The Stuart Hall Project \u2013 was to have resisted identitarian essentialism. Instead of freezing people into chains of already-existing equivalences, the point was to treat any articulation as provisional and plastic. New articulations can always be created. No-one is essentially anything. Sadly, the right act on this insight more effectively than the left does. The bourgeois-identitarian left knows how to propagate guilt and conduct a witch hunt, but it doesn't know how to make converts. But that, after all, is not the point. The aim is not to popularise a leftist position, or to win people over to it, but to remain in a position of elite superiority, but now with class superiority redoubled by moral superiority too. \u2018How dare you talk \u2013 it's we who speak for those who suffer!' But the rejection of identitarianism can only be achieved by the re-assertion of class. A left that does not have class at its core can only be a liberal pressure group. Class consciousness is always double: it involves a simultaneous knowledge of the way in which class frames and shapes all experience, and a knowledge of the particular position that we occupy in the class structure. It must be remembered that the aim of our struggle is not recognition by the bourgeoisie, nor even the destruction of the bourgeoisie itself. It is the class structure \u2013 a structure that wounds everyone, even those who materially profit from it \u2013 that must be destroyed. The interests of the working class are the interests of all; the interests of the bourgeoisie are the interests of capital, which are the interests of no-one. Our struggle must be towards the construction of a new and surprising world, not the preservation of identities shaped and distorted by capital. If this seems like a forbidding and daunting task, it is. But we can start to engage in many prefigurative activities right now. Actually, such activities would go beyond pre-figuration \u2013 they could start a virtuous cycle, a self-fulfilling prophecy in which bourgeois modes of subjectivity are dismantled and a new universality starts to build itself. We need to learn, or re-learn, how to build comradeship and solidarity instead of doing capital's work for it by condemning and abusing each other. This doesn't mean, of course, that we must always agree \u2013 on the contrary, we must create conditions where disagreement can take place without fear of exclusion and excommunication. We need to think very strategically about how to use social media \u2013 always remembering that, despite the egalitarianism claimed for social media by capital's libidinal engineers, that this is currently an enemy territory, dedicated to the reproduction of capital. But this doesn't mean that we can't occupy the terrain and start to use it for the purposes of producing class consciousness. We must break out of the \u2018debate' that communicative capitalism in which capital is endlessly cajoling us to participate in, and remember that we are involved in a class struggle. The goal is not to \u2018be' an activist, but to aid the working class to activate \u2013 and transform \u2013 itself. Outside the Vampires' Castle, anything is possible.'"

Yet the causal origins of global crisis are to be found in over-accumulation and also in contradictions of state power, or in what Marxists call the internal contradictions of the capitalist system. Moreover, because the system is now global, crisis in any one place tends to represent crisis for the system as a whole. The system cannot expand because the marginalisation of a significant portion of humanity from direct productive participation, the downward pressure on wages and popular consumption worldwide, and the polarisation of income, has reduced the ability of the world market to absorb world output. At the same time, given the particular configuration of social and class forces and the correlation of these forces worldwide, national states are hard-pressed to regulate transnational circuits of accumulation and offset the explosive contradictions built into the system. \u00b6 Is this crisis cyclical, structural, or systemic? Cyclical crises are recurrent to capitalism about once every 10 years and involve recessions that act as self-correcting mechanisms without any major restructuring of the system. The recessions of the early 1980s, the early 1990s, and of 2001 were cyclical crises. In contrast, the 2008 crisis signaled the slide into a structural crisis. Structural crises reflect deeper contra- dictions that can only be resolved by a major restructuring of the system. The structural crisis of the 1970s was resolved through capitalist globalisation. Prior to that, the structural crisis of the 1930s was resolved through the creation of a new model of redistributive capitalism, and prior to that the struc- tural crisis of the 1870s resulted in the development of corpo- rate capitalism. A systemic crisis involves the replacement of a system by an entirely new system or by an outright collapse. A structural crisis opens up the possibility for a systemic crisis. But if it actually snowballs into a systemic crisis \u2013 in this case, if it gives way either to capitalism being superseded or to a breakdown of global civilisation \u2013 is not predetermined and depends entirely on the response of social and political forces to the crisis and on historical contingencies that are not easy to forecast. This is an historic moment of extreme uncertainty, in which collective responses from distinct social and class forces to the crisis are in great flux. \u00b6 Hence my concept of global crisis is broader than financial. There are multiple and mutually constitutive dimensions \u2013 economic, social, political, cultural, ideological and ecological, not to mention the existential crisis of our consciousness, values and very being. There is a crisis of social polarisation, that is, of social reproduction. The system cannot meet the needs or assure the survival of millions of people, perhaps a majority of humanity. There are crises of state legitimacy and political authority, or of hegemony and domination. National states face spiraling crises of legitimacy as they fail to meet the social grievances of local working and popular classes experiencing downward mobility, unemployment, heightened insecurity and greater hardships. The legitimacy of the system has increasingly been called into question by millions, perhaps even billions, of people around the world, and is facing expanded counter-hegemonic challenges. Global elites have been unable counter this erosion of the system's authority in the face of worldwide pressures for a global moral economy. And a canopy that envelops all these dimensions is a crisis of sustainability rooted in an ecological holocaust that has already begun, expressed in climate change and the impending collapse of centralised agricultural systems in several regions of the world, among other indicators. By a crisis of humanity I mean a crisis that is approaching systemic proportions, threatening the ability of billions of people to survive, and raising the specter of a collapse of world civilisation and degeneration into a new \u201cDark Ages.\u201d2 \u00b6 This crisis of humanity shares a number of aspects with earlier structural crises but there are also several features unique to the present: \u00b6 1. The system is fast reaching the ecological limits of its reproduction. Global capitalism now couples human and natural history in such a way as to threaten to bring about what would be the sixth mass extinction in the known history of life on earth.3 This mass extinction would be caused not by a natural catastrophe such as a meteor impact or by evolutionary changes such as the end of an ice age but by purposive human activity. According to leading environmental scientists there are nine \u201cplanetary boundaries\u201d crucial to maintaining an earth system environment in which humans can exist, four of which are experiencing at this time the onset of irreversible environmental degradation and three of which (climate change, the nitrogen cycle, and biodiversity loss) are at \u201ctipping points,\u201d meaning that these processes have already crossed their planetary boundaries. \u00b6 2. The magnitude of the means of violence and social control is unprecedented, as is the concentration of the means of global communication and symbolic production and circulation in the hands of a very few powerful groups. Computerised wars, drones, bunker-buster bombs, star wars, and so forth, have changed the face of warfare. Warfare has become normalised and sanitised for those not directly at the receiving end of armed aggression. At the same time we have arrived at the panoptical surveillance society and the age of thought control by those who control global flows of communication, images and symbolic production. The world of Edward Snowden is the world of George Orwell; 1984 has arrived; \u00b6 3. Capitalism is reaching apparent limits to its extensive expansion. There are no longer any new territories of significance that can be integrated into world capitalism, de-ruralisation is now well advanced, and the commodification of the countryside and of pre- and non-capitalist spaces has intensified, that is, converted in hot-house fashion into spaces of capital, so that intensive expansion is reaching depths never before seen. Capitalism must continually expand or collapse. How or where will it now expand? \u00b6 4. There is the rise of a vast surplus population inhabiting a \u201cplanet of slums,\u201d4 alienated from the productive economy, thrown into the margins, and subject to sophisticated systems of social control and to destruction - to a mortal cycle of dispossession-exploitation-exclusion. This includes prison-industrial and immigrant-detention complexes, omnipresent policing, militarised gentrification, and so on; \u00b6 5. There is a disjuncture between a globalising economy and a nation-state based system of political authority. Transnational state apparatuses are incipient and have not been able to play the role of what social scientists refer to as a \u201chegemon,\u201d or a leading nation-state that has enough power and authority to organise and stabilise the system. The spread of weapons of mass destruction and the unprecedented militarisation of social life and conflict across the globe makes it hard to imagine that the system can come under any stable political authority that assures its reproduction. \u00b6 Global Police State \u00b6 How have social and political forces worldwide responded to crisis? The crisis has resulted in a rapid political polarisation in global society. Both right and left-wing forces are ascendant. Three responses seem to be in dispute. \u00b6 One is what we could call \u201creformism from above.\u201d This elite reformism is aimed at stabilising the system, at saving the system from itself and from more radical re- sponses from below. Nonetheless, in the years following the 2008 collapse of the global financial system it seems these reformers are unable (or unwilling) to prevail over the power of transnational financial capital. A second response is popular, grassroots and leftist resistance from below. As social and political conflict escalates around the world there appears to be a mounting global revolt. While such resistance appears insurgent in the wake of 2008 it is spread very unevenly across countries and regions and facing many problems and challenges. \u00b6 Yet another response is that I term 21st century fascism.5 The ultra-right is an insurgent force in many countries. In broad strokes, this project seeks to fuse reactionary political power with transnational capital and to organise a mass base among historically privileged sectors of the global working class \u2013 such as white workers in the North and middle layers in the South \u2013 that are now experiencing heightened insecurity and the specter of downward mobility. It involves militarism, extreme masculinisation, homophobia, racism and racist mobilisations, including the search for scapegoats, such as immigrant workers and, in the West, Muslims. Twenty-first century fascism evokes mystifying ideologies, often involving race/culture supremacy and xenophobia, embracing an idealised and mythical past. Neo-fascist culture normalises and glamorises warfare and social violence, indeed, generates a fascination with domination that is portrayed even as heroic.'"

Prof. in Liberal Studies @ North Carolina A & T State U., Philosophy of African American Studies: Nothing Left of Blackness, p. 7-14)' | contents: 'Marxism in Ebony Materialist Philosophical Inquiry and Black Studies In any academic discipline, there exist varying, oftentimes even conflicting, conceptual frameworks, theoretical approaches, and methods. Black Studies is no different. In light of the theoretical works prominent today, however, a number of students in AAS might easily conclude that philosophical idealism is the only school of thought. To the contrary, Black Leftist activists were significant players during the early period of Black Studies. The first introductory textbooks in African American Studies were written by Marxist/socialist scholars and activists; for instance, Peoples College's Introduction to Afro-American Studies and Clarence Munford's Production Relations, Class and Black Liberation: A Marxist Perspective in Afro-American Studies. Communist like Jack O'Dell and Robert Rhodes taught African American Studies courses at the Antioch College branch campus in Washington, D. C. And pioneering Black historian and \"antibourgeois gadfly\" Earl Thorpe - chair of the history department at North Carolina College - was recruited to teach courses on \"Marxism and Black Liberation\" for the Black Studies program at Duke University.23 However, today, Leftist thought is marginal to the politics and philosophy of Black Studies. Socialism and Marxism-Leninism are integral parts of African American history and culture. Of course, Marxist scholar/activists contributed to African American intellectual history and culture long before what is, in more formal terms, considered the advent of Black Studies during the late 1960s. In the tradition of Hubert Harrison, Susie Revels Cayton, Maude White Katz, Richard B. Moore, Paul Robeson, Oliver Cox, Eugene Holmes, Abram Harris, Claudia Jones, Walter Rodney, Angela Davis, and John McClendon, there is a need to bring the Black working-class-men and women-back into AAS. A materialist philosophy inquiry into Black Studies is grounded on three presuppositions. A materialist conception of epistemology and ontology presumes that there is a reality independent of our consciousness. A materialist ontology asserts the primacy of material reality over consciousness. And a materialist epistemology posits that this reality is knowable and knowledge or what is cognitive (social consciousness) corresponds to and thus ideally approximates this material reality. Lastly, a materialist philosophy presupposes that the social world is a stratified ontology of which class relations (i.e., social relations of production) form the ground for understanding social processes. The call for a materialist conception of science and epistemology should not be seen as a call for an essentialist ascription of AAS, wherein it is viewed only as a social scientific enterprise devoid of cultural studies. The current popularity of cultural studies, often in collaboration with various species of historicism and postmodernist trends, fosters a separation between cultural studies and social relations of production. As a school of thought, it gives less attention to the material conditions that give rise to African American culture and relativizes the objective character of the Black experience. In my estimation, the Black working-class has become lost in the whirlwind of cultural idealism. Contemporary Black cultural theory \u2013 under the spell of poststructuralism and Afrocentricity \u2013 has declared: class is dead! All that exists is intersectionality and a \"matrix of domination,\" in which everyone is oppressed \u2013 women, men, capitalist, workers, children, ad infinitum. And there is a tendency in Black Studies to transform the Black workingclass into some obscure gray matter known as the consumer, the multitude, or \u2013 my favorite from the \"friends of the poor\" \u2013 the Black underclass.24 The relevance and importance of the Black working-class must be brought to the forefront of Black Studies.25 This would entail discarding analytical notions such as \"cultural deprivation,\" \"human capital,\" \"culture of poverty,\" \"nihilism,\" \"feminization of poverty,\" \"intersectionality,\" \"underclass,\" \"cultural pathology,\" and \"menticide\" that have served to explain the contemporary and historical crisis that confronts the Black working-class. We must discard the cultural idealism of Maulana Karenga, Corne! West, Jawanza Kunjufu, Marimba Ani, Patricia Hill Collins, Molefi Asante, and William Julius Wilson who perceive the \"Negro Question'' as an ideological or axiological crisis, for example, as alienation from ancient African values, the loss of a \"love ethic,\" or the lack of human capital. When we view the \u201cNegro Question\u201d as preeminently ideological, moral, or cultural, we ultimately discount the determinate role of material contradictions rooted in class contradictions. As Robert Allen astutely noted, \" ... the question is not politics or no politics; rather it is which politics? Whom will Black Studies serve? Will it be truly democratic in its intellectual and political vision, or will it become 'apolitical' and acquiesce to a narrow, elitist and bourgeois view of education?\"26 Black Studies and the Question of Western Civilization Revisited C. L. R. James wrote what could be considered a Marxist manifesto for Black Studies in 1969. Speaking at Federal City College, James argues, at the level of theory, that Black Studies should be anti-racist and anti-imperialist in character, but not anti-white. From James's perspective, there is no intellectual space in Black Studies for philosophies of Blackness in which ancient African civilizations, values, and cultural perspectives constitute a \"presuppositionless beginning\" for Black Studies.27 He parts company with Black nationalists and their contemporary progeny (e.g., Afrocentrists) who argue that every culture rests on a metaphysical, permanent substratum that gives rise to a particular system of thought. He cogently proclaims: We need a careful systematic building up of historical, economic, political, literary ideas, knowledge and information, on the Negro question ... Because it is only where we have Bolshevik ideas, Marxist ideas, Marxist knowledge, Marxist history, Marxist perspectives, that you are certain to drive out bourgeois ideas, bourgeois history, bourgeois perspectives which are so powerful on the question of the races in the United States.28 [Italics Added] For James, the antithesis between bourgeois ideology and proletarian ideology is essential to the development, direction, and aim of Black Studies. James is often viewed as someone who was head-over-heels in love with Western culture and/or civilization. Yet, it is important to note that dialectical and historical materialism (or Marxism-Leninism) constitutes the conceptual and theoretical framework for his assessment of \"The Fate of Humanity.\" In a 1939 article, \"Revolution and the Negro\" James boldly avows, \"What we as Marxists have to see is the tremendous role played by Negroes in the transformation of Western civilization from feudalism to capitalism. It is only from this vantage-point that we shall be able to appreciate (and prepare for) the still greater role they must of necessity play in the transition from capitalism to socialism.\"29 James's classic works such as The Black ]acobins and A History of Pan-African Revolt are ardently attentive to the fact that slavery, colonialism, and imperialism are part and parcel of capitalism. Moreover, the revolutionary resistance of people of African descent ostensibly indicates the critical role of Black people as actors or subjects of history and the dialectical development of Western civilization. In unswerving disapproval of Hegel's views about Africans and their place outside of world history, James meticulously documents and effectively demonstrates that-far from being removed from world historical event-African people and their descendants in the diaspora transformed the landscape of world history in a monumental fashion.3\u00b0 Yet, James's historiography is not some form of racial vindicationism, which claims that ancient African civilization is the real source of Black historic magnitude and ultimately collective identity. Rather James offers insights into the Black struggles against slavery and colonialism as manifestations of the antagonistic contradictions within the modern (bourgeois) stage of world history. Cultural idealism has no place within James's worldview and consequently his philosophy of history. James's philosophy of history is not anti-European, anti-Western, or anti-white; his philosophy of history is stridently anti-slavery, anti-imperialist, anti-racist, and anticapitalist.31 James introduces a conceptual distinction between what is European and what is Eurocentrism. Moreover, he did not accept the abstract concept of the West as monolithic, devoid of internal class relations and contradictory class interests. Black sociologist Alex Dupuy points out that James's dialectical analysis takes into consideration the tremendous value of European culture and its influence on the African diaspora, and vice versa.32 Dupuy argues, \"James was redefining the meaning of Western culture away from its Eurocentric understanding. For [James], West Indians were a modern and Western people, though they were not European, a point [James] made in many of his writings, e.g., his semiautobiography, Beyond a Boundary (1963).\" 33 James resolutely rejected any outlook that requires Black Studies to be grounded on a uniquely formulated Black perspective (e.g., Senghor's Negritude or Karenga's Kawaida or Asante's Afrocentricity). Dupuy points out that James does not \"reject African culture in favor of Western culture.\" 34 Rather, James's analysis is based on \"a historical materialist understanding of culture\" and the recognition that \"the predominant influences in the Caribbean were those of Western Europe.\"35 As Dupuy insightfully notes, \"The Black ]acobins remains ... one of the most succinct critiques of the barbarism of Western European imperialism but also of the promise of bourgeois civilization.\"36 Any philosophy of AAS worth its salt should follow in the \"Giant Steps\" of C. L. R. James. Embracing an ethnophilosophy that is anti-European is as fruitful as masturbation. It may be pleasurable, perhaps even therapeutic, but it won't give birth to a scientific approach to Black Studies. \"And that Black Fist becomes a Red Spark\" Black Studies and Black Working-Class Studies37 In a post-Cold War world, the \"spectre of communism\" has apparently been exorcised and laid to rest. There is the widespread belief that we have witnessed the death-knell of Marxism. So, why argue for the legitimacy of and necessity for Marxism in Black Studies? No doubt this has been a hotly debated question both in the Black Liberation movement and in Black Studies for a considerable time. I tend to agree with Brian Lloyd: \"I presume that we are witnessing, not the death of Marxism, but the end of the first period during which Marxists managed to seize and, for a time, wield state power. That it has fewer adherents at the end than during other phases of this period, and that as many of them can be found in universities as in factories or fields, is neither disheartening as is imaged by some of its proponents nor as amusing as is supposed by all of its detractors.\"38 It has become the custom to summarily dismiss Marxism as a viable methodological approach and philosophical perspective for Black Studies. Most of the adversarial postures toward Marxism-Leninism in Black Studies have discounted the value of a materialist dialectical philosophy of liberation, class analysis, class struggle, proletarian internationalism, and the scientific socialist principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Despite the sharp divergence of their political views, Harold Cruse, Cedric Robinson, Cornel West, Marimba Ani, Patricia Hill Collins, and Charles Mills have condemned Marx and Marxism for everything from economic determinism to class reductionism to historical teleology and any number of other \"conceits.\" We even find Asante making such puerile statements such as the following: \"In fact, we have no history of a communist movement in the United States where communists put their bodies and l.ives on the line as African Americans did.\"39 Contrary to Asante's claim, scholars such as Mark Naison, Ted Vincent, Erik S. McDuffie, Gerald Horne, Carole Boyce Davies, Robin Kelley, Minkah Makalani, and Mark Solomon in addition to autobiographies by Harry Haywood, Hosea Hudson, and Michael Hamlin offer a much more nuanced picture of communism, socialism, and Marxism-Leninism in Black life and culture. Over the years, scholarship in labor studies and Black Studies has revealed the historical legacy of Black worker militancy. As we travel through the annals of Black history, we unearth Peter Clark's crucial involvement in the Great Railway Strike of 1877, Lucy Parsons's unflinching engagement in the Haymarket Square struggle, the heroic efforts of Ralph Gray, Tommy Gray, Eula Gray, Al Murphy, and scores of Black sharecroppers, tenant farmers, and agricultural laborers to organize the predominantly Black underground organization the Share Croppers Union, A. Philip Randolph's tireless efforts with rhe Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, Ferdinand Smith's vanguard role in the National Maritime Union and Paul Robeson's monumental efforts to use folk music to entertain Spanish Civil War loyalists and striking workers as he gave support to international socialist solidarity. We could mention the steadfast leadership of Velma Hopkins and Moranda Smith in the 1947 strike at the Reynolds Tobacco Company in Winston Salem, North Carolina. There were Black postal workers like Cleveland Morgan, a member of New York Branch 36 of the National Association of Letter Carriers, who played a seminal role in the nationwide 1970 postal wildcat strike. We could also mention the historic efforts of the League of Revolutionary Black Workers to organize wildcat strikes in Detroit, Michigan. And, in more recent times, we could mention working-class Black women who have fought against the attack on public services, such as public housing and welfare. We should not ignore the fact that many of these activists were socialists, and quite a few were Marxist-Leninist in their ideological outlook. The scholarship of Clarence Lang, John Arena, Adolph Reed, Barbara Ransby, Rhonda Y. Williams, and Joe Trotter has demonstrated the historic importance of the Black working-class to African American history and culture. They bring to light the centrality of class struggle and conflict as determinate features of what makes up the Black working-class. World capitalism gave birth to the Black working-class. The initial accumulation of large sums of capital, which in turn, was invested in the exploitation of European workers, derived from the slave trade and the plantation system in the so-called New World. In volume one of Capital, Marx so famously wrote \"capital comes dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt.\"40 The ruthless exploitation of Black bodies, in a manner of speaking, became the proverbial goose that lays golden eggs, possessing the magical ability to increase the magnitude of capital. Incidentally, the profitability of the \"proverbial goose\" prompted slaveholder Thomas Jefferson to remark, \"it would never do to destroy the goose.\"41 Leaving the decks of the slave ship, \"In the Name of Jesus,\" large numbers of Wolof, Mande, Fulani, and Mandingo were bound together by chains, from neck to neck and wrist to wrist.42 Out of the diversity of African ethnic groups a new synthesis was formed under the brutal system of capitalist slavery, giving birth to African Americans. The incessant \"demand for Black labor\" by Northern industrial capital and the plantation bourgeoisie fueled world capitalist development. Black slaves toiled in textile mills, shipyards, sawmills, and coalmines from Virginia to Mississippi. Black women labored on tobacco fields in the Carolina piedmont and picked cotton on plantations along the coast of Georgia. Black men like Tom Molineaux and Black women like Sylvia DuBois were given release time from slave labor in order to engage in athletic labor (as boxers) to bring entertainment and profits to slaveholders and the larger white Southern community. 43 From the seventeenth century to the twenty-first century, from slave plantations to auto factories, Black women, men, and children labored under the hard times of capitalist exploitation. The brutal forces unleashed by the capitalist drive for surplus value laid the foundation for the development of African American life and culture, from religion to music.44 Presently, we are witnessing, from New York to North Carolina to Missouri to Wisconsin to California, concerted attacks on public sector workers in order to resolve the economic crisis ravaging US capitalism. We cannot ignore the fact that Black people are prominent in the leadership as well as in the rank and file in a great number of these mass demonstrations. In cities throughout the country, working-class men and women, Black, white, and Latino, are being blown away by police officers who are ultimately protected by the rule of law. In the aftermath of the murders of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Aiyanna Jones, Yvette Smith, Rekia Boyd, and Eric Garner, Black working people are not silently standing by while the \"Lords of Capital\" via their \"special bodies of armed men'' \u2013 with military weapons and tanks \u2013 confront them in the streets. This seminal point is lost on Black critics of Marxism during the past 90 years. As numerous studies in AAS have demonstrated, the working-class is not one-dimensional, exclusively composed of white people. The working-class is composed of women, men, and children, in addition to being multinational in character. Marxist studies of Black working-class life and culture are needed now more than ever because in the souls of the Black working-class the grapes of wrarh are filling and growing heavy. As Karl Marx so famously put it, \"The weapon of criticism cannot, of course, replace criticism of the weapon, material force must be overthrown by material force; but theory also becomes a material force as soon as it has gripped the masses.\"45 Philosophy of African American Studies, I hope, wilt serve a prolegomena to the Herculean task of developing a philosophy of AAS from the standpoint of materialism. How well I have backed up this reaffirmation of philosophical materialism and revolutionary socialism with good arguments I leave it to my readers to judge. But the attempt to do so provides an answer-satisfactory to me at least-to justify writing this book.'"

U.S. presidents throughout America's political history have futilely engaged in the rhetoric of health equality and justice for over a century. In 1912\u2014ironically, the year the British Parliament passed that country's National Insurance Act\u2014President Teddy Roosevelt introduced \u201csocial insurance\u201d in an effort to provide universal medical coverage \u201cagainst the hazards of sickness\u201d as part of the Progressive Bull Moose platform, which declared, \u201cThe supreme duty of the Nation is the conservation of human resources through an enlightened measure of social and industrial justice.\u201d31 In 1945, President Harry Truman delivered a special message to Congress recommending a comprehensive national health program as part of an Economic Bill of Rights that ensured \u201cthe right to adequate medical care . . . the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health . . . [and] the right to adequate protection from the economic fears of sickness.\u201d32 When President Lyndon Johnson signed the Social Security Act of 1965 into law, establishing the Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs, his words described a reform aimed at eliminating \u201cthe injustice that denies the miracle of healing to the old and to the poor.\u201d33 President Richard Nixon, speaking to Congress in 1974 to introduce his Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan, began by declaring that \u201cone of the most cherished goals of our democracy is to assure every American an equal opportunity to lead a full and productive life\u201d34 as he implored the legislature to expand Medicare, Medicaid, and mandatory employer-based insurance coverage. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter proposed a \u201cNational Health Plan,\u201d citing the challenge to \u201csecure for all Americans access to quality health care as a matter of right.\u201d35 A decade later, President Bill Clinton introduced the Health Security Act of 1993 in a bid to achieve universal coverage through managed competition.36 Most recently, upon passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which enacts insurance reforms intended to expand health coverage to 25 million previously uninsured Americans, President Barack Obama declared, \u201cTonight's vote is not a victory for any one party\u2014it's a victory . . . for the American people.\u201d The president's remarks reinforced the equality objectives that underlie this act, calling the new reform a \u201csystem that works better for the American people.\u201d37 The American political effort to achieve health justice through universal access has spanned decades and crossed the political spectrum. Nevertheless, our nation's focus has been on achieving equal access to health care, not on achieving equal health care quality for all Americans. The political goal has been to expand access to health insurance so that a larger number of Americans can purchase health care. While achieving equitable access to health care encounters is essential, true equality in health care demands more. Equal access to health care will not change the disparate health outcomes that minority patients suffer as long as the quality of the care to which they are afforded access remains substantively inequitable. Political leaders have given little attention to the injustices that will persist even if we succeed in universalizing access to medical insurance. These include the systemic inequities that affect minority health, such as poor housing, employment, education, and food security, as well as inferior medical treatment. Interventions to correct inequities in these social determinants of health are at the bottom-most tier of Frieden's health impact pyramid. The effort to universalize access to health insurance, in contrast, represents a protective intervention situated in the center of the health impact pyramid. Universal health insurance importantly will reach individuals needing access to health care services, but it will not change the collective attitudes that permeate the health care services they access. In point of fact, the theory of distributive justice that motivates efforts to enact universal coverage actually supports a much broader view of the nature and the moral importance of health and health care equity than our legislative efforts have addressed. Recognizing that it is beyond the capacity of any health care system to guarantee all its citizens will get all the health care that they want, or even all that they need, ethicists have explored the principles that must guide any society's difficult decisions concerning the fair distribution of scarce yet life-saving medical resources. Health justice advocates recognize there is a difference between the obligation to guarantee just and equal access to health care and the impossible goal of guaranteeing just and equal access to health itself. Some differences in health care and health outcomes are inevitable and are neither the evidence for nor the result of injustice. Norman Daniels provides one of the most widely accepted descriptions of the nature of true health justice. He argues that just access to health and health care needs is especially important because it allows each individual member of society equal enjoyment of the normal range of all other opportunities the society has to offer. Daniels goes further to identify the level of responsibility for ensuring just health care: I shall urge a normative claim: we ought to subsume health care under a principle of justice guaranteeing fair equality of opportunity. . . . If an acceptable theory of justice includes a principle providing for fair equality of opportunity, then health-care institutions should be among those governed by it.38 Importantly, Daniels's concept of health justice does not focus or operate exclusively on the individual level, but instead also incorporates institutional accountability. Even though Daniels's is a theory of distributional justice\u2014arguing that society must fairly allocate health care in order to equip all members of society to participate in the normal range of life's opportunities\u2014his theory requires systemic, institutional level changes in order for justice to be achieved. Daniels admits to the need for exogenous governance to achieve health justice. In short, distributional fairness alone will not eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities. Establishing a just health care system will require rooting out implicit biases that affect patients differentially. The goal must be to achieve substantive as well as distributive justice in American health care. Neither expanded MCAT testing, nor additional research, nor complex clinical regulations, nor principled professional standards, nor political efforts to expand health care access has proved effective to reduce, much less eliminate, racial and ethnic health care disparities. These reforms address disparities through interventions at the top three tiers of the health impact pyramid. Although the fundamental reforms in socioeconomic factors are beyond the scope of this book, the need to change the context in which health care is delivered\u2014the fourth tier of the health impact pyramid\u2014is well within reach and acutely indicated by the data and narratives collected in this book. The physician and patient narratives assembled here qualitatively describe the injustice and daily damage visited upon minority patients by health care disparities. Furthermore, the enormity of these inequities can also be quantified. One source has estimated that over 30 percent of the direct medical costs that African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans incur are excess costs due to health inequities\u2014nearly $230 billion over a three-year period between 2003 and 2006.39 In 2005, Dr. David Satcher estimated that 83,570 deaths occur each year as a result of racial and ethnic health disparities.40 In other words, inferior, racially biased health care kills people of color and costs them lots of money while doing so! Improvements in the overall quality of medical care in the United States have narrowed persistent gaps in some key disparities indicators.41 Yet, our nation is making disturbingly little progress finding an effective solution to the structural nature of these injustices. Evidence of a Structural Problem Despite the serious responses to a serious disparities problem, in 2012, for the tenth year in a row, the United States Department of Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) released evidence that the fight against health disparities is stalled. AHRQ's annual report on National Healthcare Quality and Disparities gives data that describes the progress American health care has made in reducing health care disparities. The 2012 report records changes in disparities over the period from 2002 to 2010 by racial and ethnic groups, basing these changes on measures of quality such as the number of deaths due to cancer and heart attacks and the incidence of end-stage renal disease due to diabetes. The AHRQ also reports changes in disparities in access to health care for the period from 2002 to 2009. Figure 8.2 depicts the lack of progress. The graph on the left shows the number of quality measures that represent a gap between health care delivered to minority and white Americans and how those measures are changing. The graph on the right shows the number and extent to which measures of disparaty have improved. Both graphs also show changes in the gap between high- and low-income groups for the quality and access measures. The disquieting message presented is that the overwhelming majority of disparities by race and ethnicity are static. In spite of focused attention from law- and policymakers, health care providers, and scholars, figure 8.2 paints a dispiriting picture of how far we have not come. According to figure 8.2, well over 80 percent of the measures that describe quality and access disparities for health care have remained unchanged or have grown worse over the report period. Disparate health care quality measures have improved in absolute terms between 2002 and 2010. However, the gap between quality improvements for whites and people of color has been relatively constant. A few disparities in quality of care are getting smaller. The disparity quality measures that are improving generally have to do with acute hospital care. However, the rates at which minority and white adult surgery patients receive preventative care are not improving. Some examples of widening gaps between whites and minority patient quality outcomes include the number of maternal deaths in childbirth, the number of infants who receive vaccines, the number of diabetic adults who get their glucose levels tested annually, the incidence of breast cancer diagnosed at advanced versus early stages, the number of adults over age fifty who receive preventative care in the form of colonoscopy or other diagnostic procedures, and the number of children for whom a health provider gave advice about using car safety seats. Perhaps there is some comfort in the fact that a greater number of measured disparities are improving than are worsening. Still the short and troubling story is that most disparities in the quality of health care delivered to whites as compared to patients of minority racial and ethnic groups are not changing at all. Sadly, the data shows that even less progress is being made equalizing disparities related to access to care. The access gap between Asians and whites grew smaller for four of the nineteen categories measured, improving disparities for that group by 21 percent. But over the period between 2002 and 2009, virtually none of the disparities between other minority populations and white Americans have improved. I submit that the only reforms that will significantly and effectively narrow the health disparities that AHRQ has reported over the last decade must fit into the bottom tiers of Frieden's health action pyramid. I propose a fourth tier intervention that will change the health delivery context to make individual physicians' default decisions healthier. My proposal aims to change the social norm surrounding unconscious racism and to affect the context in which health decisions are made, following the tradition of public health successes. For example, when a municipality fluoridates its water supply or implements clean air regulations, individuals in the community can benefit without having to exercise their individual agency to choose a health-enhancing option. I propose changing the context in which health care delivery occurs by reforming antidiscrimination law. Legal reforms will impact social norms and will incentivize long-lasting protective interventions by institutional health care providers. Institutions will create a climate for change because they will be corporately incentivized to articulate nondiscriminatory goals clearly and adopt compliance policies, procedures, and infrastructure to implement nondiscriminatory training, assessment, and enforcement. The solution I propose is designed to maximize the population-wide impact of reducing implicit biases, while also requiring individual effort to address the cognitive formation of these biases and the discriminatory conduct that they inspire. The Courage to Make Unconscious Racism Illegal Let us return to the theme raised in chapter 1: Bad laws allow discrimination to flourish, harming the health and shortening the lives of racial and ethnic minorities. Good laws can reduce discrimination in health care and ultimately change the social climate in the way that civil rights laws eventually made explicit prejudice intolerable. Throughout this book we have seen the tenacity of health disparities and the serious injuries they cause. The Biased Care Model identified six mechanisms through which implicit biases operate to produce health disparities. The literature on malleability defined the types of interventions that can alter the cognitive processes that form implicit biases and translate them into harmful discriminatory conduct. However, we have yet to see how these interventions can be generalized to affect broad contextual changes in the health care industry. We have yet to see how this information can be brought to bear to reduce health disparities. I propose that making discrimination due to unconscious racism illegal\u2014forbidden by explicit and enforceable law\u2014will change the context, incentives, and outcomes in health care, and will thereby reduce health disparities. A legal prohibition against the unconscious racism that causes health and health care disparities would accomplish a paradigmatic and structural change in the way American health care is delivered in three ways. An anti-implicit bias discrimination law would first signal a societal commitment to equality and justice in health care. This would be a paradigm shift, redefining the social norm around health disparities generally, but more specifically removing the ambivalence concerning the culpability of health disparities caused by unconscious racism. Laws effectively influence social norms by reflecting underlying social values that exist but about which there is incomplete information or uncertainty. Law serves to reflect commonly endorsed beliefs so that a community or society can live in accordance with collectively shared values. In health care, a law against unconscious racial discrimination would reflect the community consensus that we have seen among physicians who explicitly prefer equality and fairness in health care, but are surprised by the presence and influence of their unconscious biases. Moreover, an anti- implicit bias law in health care would extend the general disapprobation that Americans feel toward overt racial prejudice, bigotry, and discrimination. Conversely, an antidiscrimination law that accounts for implicit bias would endorse the generally shared value that favors equal rights and opportunity for all people of all racial and ethnic backgrounds. However, legal expression of these values is particularly important and necessary in health care where the discrimination arises from the unconscious biases that are not well understood by most. In the health care context, this uncertainty arises in large part from the limited understanding that physicians and health care providers have about the connection between their implicit biases and the inequitable health outcomes that minorities suffer. As seen in the experiment by Dr. Alexander Green, physicians who are \u201cclued into\u201d the impact their implicit biases have on their medical decision-making want to change. Certainly anyone who reads this book or undertakes to systematically review the empirical social science literature about implicit bias in health care will have the information needed to understand the connection between unconscious racism and the inferior health care that minorities experience. However, only legal intervention will serve to generalize this information and signal to health providers and all others that the connection exists but will not be allowed to persist. A legal intervention prohibiting unconscious racism would serve the same purpose that legal bans and restrictions on smoking have served. To the extent that there was uncertainty or incomplete information about the health harms caused by second-hand smoke, legislative enactments sent a strong message that the dangers had been sufficiently proven to require legislative action to protect against a serious public health threat. Enacting prohibitory laws served as a collective signal to increase certainty.42 The same collective signal is needed to establish a new contextual understanding of the devastating health harms caused by unconscious racism. Secondly, an express, enforceable legal prohibition against unconscious racism in he'"

The Politics of Health, Part II, https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/is-the-path-to-racial-health-equity-paved-with-reparations-the-politics-of-health-part-ii/#!' | contents: 'At the same time, the government's persistent failure to create a public health care system played a foundational role in structuring American health care inequalities, both by class and race. Despite high hopes that the New Deal might realize such a system, Franklin Roosevelt failed to make health reform a priority (among other issues, he wasn't enthusiastic about the prospects of confronting the rather reactionary doctors' lobby).[5] At the end of World War II, a major campaign for national health insurance did emerge, backed by both Harry S. Truman and \u2014 critically \u2014 organized labor.[6] \u201cOur new economic bill of rights,\u201d Truman proclaimed to Congress in 1945, \u201cshould mean health security for all, regardless of residence, station, or race \u2013 everywhere in the United States.\u201d[7] Yet this bold vision was soon smothered, the victim of a toxic redbaiting campaign pursued by the American Medical Association (AMA).[8] All that survived of it, at least in the short term, was the Hill-Burton Act, a law that funded a massive campaign of hospital-building throughout the nation. But Hill-Burton was permeated with racism from its birth. While in theory it forbid discrimination by race, the law nonetheless made an allowance for \u201cseparate but equal\u201d facilities.[9] The implications were clear: explicit medical segregation had received the imprimatur of the law, together with generous public subsidization.\u00b6 Only through the combined force of the civil rights movement, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a number of key legal challenges, and the passage of Medicare in 1965 could the rollback of American apartheid medicine begin, as will be discussed in more detail below. For now, it's worth noting that the impact of the civil rights movement on black health was not insignificant, as demonstrated in a revealing 2013 study by epidemiologist Nancy Krieger and colleagues. In the early 1960s, these investigators found that black infant death rates were significantly higher in \u201cJim Crow\u201d states (the 21 states, plus the District of Columbia, with racial discrimination on the law books) than in non-Jim Crow states. This is hardly surprising. Yet, during the late 1960s, the death rate of the former group did improve, and by the 1970s the difference had evaporated. This can be touted as evidence that political change can yield real improvements in health over time. But two additional facts complicate this interpretation. First, after 2000, the gap again opened up, albeit to a lesser extent. And, second, regardless of the impact of the Civil Rights movement on disparities among blacks, throughout this period black infant death rates were still twice that of whites.[10]\u00b6 Meanwhile, in terms of life expectancy, recent years have seen the reduction \u2014 but not the elimination \u2014 of black-white inequalities. As the Centers for Disease Control reported last November, the difference in life expectancy between the two groups fell from 5.9 years (in 1999) to 3.6 years (in 2013). However, even this may not be entirely goods news. A widely covered study published last fall found a unique and disturbing rise in mortality among middle-aged whites (of lower socioeconomic status) between 1999 and 2013, leading the investigators to conclude that falling white-black mortality disparities in this age group \u201cwas largely driven by increased white mortality.\u201d[11]\u00b6 Moreover, during this same period and on into the present, a series of events have functioned as starkly visible and undeniable examples of ongoing structural health racism. Following the death last year of Freddie Gray while in policy custody, many made note of the enormous chasm in health and mortality between black neighborhoods like his and adjacent wealthier and whiter ones. Other commentators have highlighted \u201cenvironmental racism,\u201d or inequities in exposure to environmental hazards by race, emblematic of embedded structural inequality. Revealing reporting by the Washington Post, for instance, described Gray's history of childhood lead poisoning, an exposure that is in part racially patterned. More recently, mass poisoning by lead in Flint, Michigan \u2014 the disastrous consequence of dimwitted austerity and structural marginalization \u2014 has provided yet more evidence of the downstream health consequences of political exclusion.\u00b6 Inequalities in criminal justice itself \u2014 specifically mass incarceration and police violence \u2014 are now being explicitly contextualized within a framework of health.[12] In protest of such inequalities (made starkly visible by the killings of men like Eric Garner and the ensuing \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d protests), medical students throughout the country have begun to advocate for change \u2014 for instance, with a solidarity \u201cdie-in\u201d action on December 10, 2014, which in turn led to the formation of a new racial health justice organization (\u201cWhite Coats for Black Lives\u201d) on Martin Luther King Day in 2015.[13]\u00b6 Finally, two new books are tackling head-on the problem of racial health inequality, albeit from very different \u201cexpert\u201d perspectives \u2014 one from within medicine and the other from a legal perspective. Damon Tweedy's Black Man in a White Coat, released last year, is a thoughtful memoir that explores the nexus of race and medicine through the eyes of a black physician. Law professor Dayna Bowen Matthew's Just Medicine: A Cure for Racial Inequality in American Health Care, on the other hand, is an integration of legal analysis and social science that culminates in an overarching policy recommendation.\u00b6 In what follows, I'll first examine the issue of racism within the medical profession, turning to Tweedy's experiences and reflections as described in his book. Next, I'll focus on Matthew's book, and examine the problem of explicit and implicit medical discrimination historically and in the present \u2014 and how civil rights law might be used to combat it. From there, I'll discuss the place of the health system in the perpetuation of inequalities, and the largely neglected role that health care universalism plays in \u201chealth equality.\u201d\u00b6 Lastly \u2014 but most importantly \u2014 I'll explore how health inequities by race and by class intersect. To phrase the question plainly: Does confronting the problem of racial health inequality mean that we must embrace the cause of economic redistribution, as discussed in the first part of this essay? If so, should this economic redistribution proceed within the context of social democracy (or democratic socialism?), or should it \u2014 must it \u2014 proceed along explicitly racial lines? Is the path to racial health equity paved with \u201creparations\u201d?\u00b6 \u00b6 2. Black doctors: Discrimination within the profession\u00b6 The plotline of Steven Soderbergh's unnerving and beautifully shot series The Knick tackles racism within the medical profession by making it viscerally visible in another era. Set in a downtown Manhattan hospital at the turn of the 19th century, the black, eminently qualified physician, Algernon Edwards (Andrew Holland), is treated with derision and disdain by many of the hospital's white staff and administrators. At the same time, the hospital turns away black patients from its outpatient clinic; Edwards surreptitiously begins treating them \u2014 under rather suboptimal operative conditions \u2014 in the hospital's basement.[14]\u00b6 But what about after the time period depicted in this series? Into the mid-20th century, blacks were excluded from many medical schools, and those who graduated faced intense discrimination in the course of practice. For instance, even decades after the events depicted in the Knick, black physicians were unable to provide care for their hospitalized patients in the South. This was because physicians needed to gain entry into county medical societies as a prerequisite to hospital-admitting privileges; and, in the South, these societies entirely or almost entirely denied blacks membership. The AMA virtuously professed that it opposed discrimination, and yet excused itself from doing anything, claiming it was impotent to compel integration. It took decades of political pressure to force change. In 1968, the Medical Committee for Human Rights, a health-oriented civil rights group, took matters into its own hands, invading the AMA's convention at the extravagant Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. Such actions \u2014 in conjunction with the Civil Rights Act and the passage of Medicare \u2014 ultimately contributed to the AMA's vote later that year to expel county societies that excluded black members, at long last forcing their disgracefully delayed integration.[15]\u00b6 This is, of course, not to say that blacks subsequently gained equal footing within the medical profession. Black representation in US medical schools has remained proportionally low over the decades, especially for men. Indeed, a report from the Association of American Medical Colleges last year showed that the number of black male matriculants in medical school is lower now \u2014 in absolute terms \u2014 than it was in the late 1970s. Tweedy, now an assistant professor of psychiatry at Duke University Medical Center, was one of these matriculants. In his book, he describes some of the challenges he faced.\u00b6 In addition to being one of only \u201ca handful of black students\u201d in his class at Duke Medical School, Tweedy came from a working class family, in stark contrast to the majority of his classmates. On the one hand, Tweedy highlights the importance of affirmative action: \u201cSo there it was: Not only was I admitted to Duke, when in a color-blind world I might not have been, but I had arrived with a full-tuition scholarship in hand.\u201d On the other hand, his first exchange as a first year student with a medical school professor was markedly inauspicious: the professor approached him to ask if he was there to fix the lights. While he was a medical student, patients routinely queried him about his presumed basketball skills. Far worse was his interaction as a resident with a racist patient and his confederate-flag adorned family (\u201cI don't want no nigger doctor,\u201d the patient told a nurse). Tweedy's diligence and persistence ultimately, however, won them over. On another occasion, a black patient rejected him, presuming his medical skills to be inferior and seeing the assignment as evidence of racist mistreatment of him as a patient. Given the insecurities that afflict medical students and trainees in general, we can only imagine the additional strain created by such presumptions and prejudices.\u00b6 Tweedy's book is also very much about the experience of black patients. He bears witness to the second-class care they too frequently experience when, for instance, as a medical student he spends time in a makeshift rural clinic, \u201cnestled within a group of dingy trailers and makeshift houses.\u201d The clinic serves poor black patients who cannot afford prescribed treatments. They are likely to see a different doctor at every visit and receive grossly insufficient preventive care. In another chapter, he describes how one black patient, who quite reasonably declines one of his team's medical recommendations, is dispatched with a punitive psychiatric diagnosis.\u00b6 Toward the conclusion of his book, Tweedy briefly explores the larger and looming question: what is the cause of racial health inequalities? Early in his medical career, he had assumed \u2014 like many others \u2014 that genetic differences were the primary factor. And indeed, for years, a huge amount of resources have gone into uncovering the genetic sources of health disparities. However, as Jason Silverstein explains in a revealing article in The Atlantic (\u201cGenes Don't Cause Racial-Health Disparities, Society Does\u201d), this money may have been better spent elsewhere. He describes a 2015 paper that systematically reviewed the collective evidence thus far for the proposition that genetic factors explain racial cardiovascular disparities. It's worth quoting from the study's conclusion:\u00b6 The results reveal a striking absence of evidence to support the assertion that any important component of observed disparities in these diseases arises from main-effect genetic mechanisms as we currently understand them \u2026 Despite the enormous social investment in genomic studies, this research program has not yet provided valuable population-relevant insights into disparities in the most common cause of morbidity and mortality.[16]\u00b6 Why then, Silverstein asks the study's lead author, do genomics still get so much attention? The author responds with a sentiment I've long suspected: if inequalities are built into the very base pairs of our genetic code, what can we really do to alleviate them? More research? In effect, as the investigator tells Silverstein, the fact is that racism and inequities are let off the hook if our genes are the culprits. Tweedy notes that he came to reject this genetic explanation: even if genetic factors play some role with respect to specific diseases, they explain little of the overall differences in health between races.\u00b6 In contrast, there are reams of evidence that point to social and economic inequalities as drivers of racial inequalities. In the first part of this essay, I focused on the impact of economic injustices on health: a large body of literature has demonstrated that poverty, for instance, is associated with a panoply of poor health outcomes, and some researchers argue that inequality itself causes worse health for everyone in society (perhaps via increased psychosocial strain as well as other factors).[17] No doubt such socioeconomic factors are a major factor in racial health inequalities, given the tight association between economic status and race.[18] Similarly, differences in health care access associated with race (like being uninsured) are no doubt factors as well.\u00b6 But what might be said about the role of racially discriminatory treatment itself? This issue has received increased attention since the 2002 publication of an Institute of Medicine evidence report, Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial Disparities in Health Care. Tweedy quotes from the report's conclusion: \u201cAlthough myriad sources contribute to [health] disparities, some evidence suggests that bias, prejudice, and stereotyping on the part of the healthcare providers may contribute to differences in care.\u201d Or, as he puts it, the \u201cdoctor-patient relationship itself serves as a catalyst for differing outcomes,\u201d which is in part the result of the fact that \u201csome doctors are prone to hold negative views about the ability of black patients to manage their health and therefore might recommend different, and possibly substandard, treatments to them.\u201d\u00b6 This issue \u2014 namely, the problem of racially disparate treatment \u2014 is the central focus of Dayna Bowen Matthew's book. She explores how \u201cimplicit bias,\u201d as she terms it, deforms physician behavior; in her view, it constitutes the most neglected determinant of inferior health among blacks.\u00b6 \u00b6 3. Jim Crow medicine: Past and present\u00b6 Matthew is a law professor with appointments at both the University of Colorado Law School and the Colorado School of Public Health. Matthew is also one of the founders of the Colorado Health Equity Project, a multidisciplinary organization that works to \u201cremove legal barriers to equal health access and health outcomes for Colorado's vulnerable populations,\u201d as its website puts it. Her ambitious book lays out a case for a legal remedy for racial health inequality.\u00b6 Key to her argument is the historical context of civil rights law, which she sees as a swinging pendulum. Hill-Burton, as we've seen, legally enshrined the \u201cseparate-but-equal\u201d standard \u2014 established in the Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson \u2014 within the health care system. Legal challenges to this standard were unsuccessful, until Simkins v. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, the \u201cwatershed case,\u201d as Matthew puts it, initiated its unraveling. As she recounts it, the case was brought by black practitioners and patients against a discriminatory hospital in North Carolina that received Hill-Burton funds. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals decided in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring, as quoted by Matthew, that \u201cRacial discrimination by hospitals visits severe consequences upon Negro physicians and their patients.\u201d\u00b6 She describes two consequences that flowed from this decision. First, the case helped catalyze subsequent successful health-care related civil rights litigation throughout the country. Second, the decision \u2014 which the Supreme Court importantly declined to reconsider \u2014 helped lead the way to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. According to Matthew, Congress took the Supreme Court's decision not to accept the case as a signal that it saw hospital segregation as unconstitutional (and, indeed, several legislators explicitly cited the Simkins decision during debate over the bill). Much good came from this: \u201cFrom 1963 through the early 1990s,\u201d Matthew writes, \u201cTitle VI proved an effective weapon against the segregation and discrimination that minority patients and physicians had experienced in American health care since the colonial era.\u201d For instance, the Johnson administration required hospitals to comply with Title VI in order to be eligible for Medicare payment. Few could afford not to, and so the age of explicit hospital segregation finally came to a close.\u00b6 Yet Matthew asserts that, to an extent, this more auspicious era ended abruptly in 2001, when a more conservative Supreme Court ruled in Alexander v. Sandoval, in a decision written by Justice Antonin Scalia, that Title VI was applicable only in cases of deliberate discrimination; disparate impact was not enough.[19] This new standard precluded a great deal of civil rights litigation because it required that plaintiffs produce tangible evidence that racist health care was intentional, which is made difficult when, as she notes, \u201cfew Americans are careless enough to create an evidentiary record of outright bigotry.\u201d Thus, according to Matthew, with respect to health care discrimination, this decision effectively rendered Title VI \u201ca dead letter.\u201d This decision, she argues, must be undone if progress against racial health inequalities is to proceed. In short, unconscious racism in health care must, according to her, be made illegal through an act of Congress and an expansion of Title VI.\u00b6 This may sound Orwellian to some. Is it meaningful, after all, to talk about outlawing sentiments or attitudes that lie deep within the dark depths of our unconscious? Can we root out biases if we are, by definition, unaware of their very existence? Matthew marshals a body of literature from various disciplines to answer in the affirmative. Conscious racism, she argues, is slowly being replaced by the unconscious variety: \u201cBut while overt racism is subject to nearly universal derision, unconscious racism due to implicit bias is hidden, is tolerated, and even excused despite its destructiveness.\u201d She persuasively explores various literatures demonstrating that physicians harbor unconscious negative perceptions of blacks. She cites studies that show that patient race affects which treatments doctors recommend, how much time they spend with patients, \u201cthe level of verbal exchange and shared decision-making in which they engage\u201d with patients, and even the manner of their nonverbal engagement. She concludes that there is a sufficient base of evidence to conclude that these implicit biases contribute to disparities, that there is reason to believe that such biases, even though they are implicit, are remediable, and that health care providers \u2014 both on the individual and institutional level \u2014 can therefore be held legally responsible for the results of their implicit biases.\u00b6 The \u201cevidence of malleability\u201d is strong, according to Matthew. In other words, she thinks specific interventions can mitigate implicit biases and, as a result, disparate outcomes. The sorts of interventions she envisions, however, seem of mixed applicability and utility. Nonetheless, overall, she makes a strong case that clinicians make racially biased decisions, whether or not they intend to, and that this issue must be directly addressed. People like me \u2014 that is to say, white physicians who believe they are immune from racially biased thought and action \u2014 have a great deal to gain from reading this book.\u00b6 That said, it is also important to examine the larger picture. There is no question that more needs to be done to address physician bias. Yet we also have to keep in mind that, in the pre-Alexander v. Sandoval era (when Title VI was, according to Matthew, more robust), there were still large racial inequalities. Litigation may be a useful tool, but it's a limited, post-facto modality.\u00b6 More broadly, the recommendations of both Tweedy and Matthew ultimately seem inadequate. Neither gives much credence to the notion that further increasing the universalism of the health system might play an important role in reducing inequalities. Moreover, Tweedy says nothing, and Matthew only a little,[20] about the notion of economic redistribution as a tool against racial health inequalities. In fairness, these concerns are not the focus of their books. However, to my mind, they are crucial considerations in the larger discussion of racial health care justice.\u00b6 \u00b6 4. Health equity and health system universalism\u00b6 Martin Luther Kings Jr.'s statement on the evils of health inequality is frequently quoted, but not usually in its full form. In his 1966 speech at the annual meeting of the aforementioned Medical Committee for Human Rights, he said, \u201cOf all the forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and the most inhuman because it often results in physical death.\u201d[21] Indeed, studies have shown a statistical association between lack of insurance and mortality. Removing the boundaries between individuals and the health care system is a critical step in the movement toward health care equality.\u00b6 Tw'"

In fact, we might even argue that the social reproduction of a whitened civil society, one that continually and progressively secures substantive rights and actual liberties for white and non-Black people, relies heavily on formal and informal practices of sexualized violence against Black Women. Scholars have increasingly turned to the language of the \"medical plantation\" and its descendant \"medical Jim Crow\" to explain the proliferation of segregation and coerced medical experimentation in state-funded medical facilities for Black patients. The medical plantation was a type of plantation whose enslaved inhabitants were made available to medical researchers as models for the study of human (that is white and non-Black) biology. Health activists like W. Montague Cobb (1904\u20131990), head of the NAACP National Health Committee and Editor of the Journal of the National Medical Association organized a major plank of the long civil rights movement focused exclusively on that dimension of the afterlife of slavery that is more commonly known as medical discrimination. It was these health activists who organized with North Carolina medical personnel to successfully challenge segregation in state-funded medical facilities in the 1963 landmark case, Simkins vs. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital. Like activists in the Black Women's Health Project28 based in Georgia and Florida just a few years later in 1984, central questions of reproduction have to do with whether, when, or if such persons would or could shoulder the weight of themselves, their families, their histories, and their memories in a world in which structural forms of violence (those forms of violence which allegedly have no origins) directed in peculiar and lasting ways at them would never even be named, mentioned, or alluded to except to shame them.

In one sense, identity politics is an inevitable part of the political awakening of many members of oppressed groups within society. Recognising that you are oppressed, and that you can fight against your oppression through a common struggle with others who share the same oppression, is a vital first step.\u00b6 However, the history of struggle against oppression shows that, on the basis of experience, those participating tend to go beyond identity politics as they recognise the root cause of their oppression lies in the structure of society. The highest point of the vast rebellion against racism in the US in the 1950s and 1960s, for example, was reached by the Black Panthers, who were founded in 1966 with the magnificent concept: \u201cWe do not fight racism with racism. We fight racism with solidarity. We do not fight exploitative capitalism with black capitalism. We fight capitalism with basic socialism\u201d.\u00b6 Today, both the #BlackLivesMatter rebellion and the movement for $15 Now are the first stages of a new mass uprising against poverty and racism in the US. However, the pushing back of consciousness globally over the decades following the collapse of Stalinism in the late 1980s and the capitalist triumphalism that accompanied it, mean that the new movements did not begin where the Panthers left off, with a socialist outlook. Nonetheless, there is a growing anti-capitalist mood among young people in the US, which is a first step to drawing socialist conclusions.\u00b6 At the same time, identity politics is many activists' starting point. While those involved in struggle may see this mainly as a means to fight back, the form of identity politics that has emanated from the universities and has dominated over recent decades concentrates overwhelmingly on discussing personal experience of oppression rather than trying to find the means to end it.\u00b6 This includes all the strands of identity politics that have become more prominent in recent years, such as intersectionality and privilege theory. In Britain these concepts remain little known in wider society but have become commonplace in, for example, university feminist societies. Intersectionalists argue that different oppressions \u2018intersect'. Indeed, they do: a black working-class woman is triply oppressed, for example. But intersectionalists often see their role as cataloguing and describing oppressions and their intersections rather than abolishing them.\u00b6 Supporters of \u2018privilege theory' are best known for telling people to \u2018check their privilege' during (often online) debates. The founder of privilege theory, Peggy McIntosh, argued that a white, upper-class, heterosexual man, for example, is carrying around an \u2018invisible knapsack' full of unearned privileges. The argument goes that power is not concentrated in the hands of one class, or in the state, but is spread throughout society and therefore exists in all social and interpersonal relationships. Privilege theory states that every individual is part of a multiplicity of oppressive relationships. It concentrates overwhelmingly on exhortations to individuals to change, to check their privilege.\u00b6 But it is not possible to eliminate either oppressions or privileges merely by exhorting individuals to change their behaviour. In fact, in many countries there have been significant improvements in social attitudes to different forms of oppression in recent decades, but they have not resulted in the ending of the oppressions concerned.\u00b6 Racism ingrained\u00b6 In Britain, for example, while racist prejudices are still widespread, crude racist ideas are far less socially acceptable than they were 30 years ago. This has come about for a number of reasons, above all the determination and increased confidence of black and Asian people to fight discrimination and racism. Another important factor was the widespread involvement of black and Asian workers in the trade unions in a common struggle alongside white workers. Both of these factors helped to foster a strong feeling among a large section of the white population, especially youth, that racism is wrong and should be combated.\u00b6 Nonetheless, racism remains deeply ingrained in British society. The police are up to 28 times more likely to stop and search you if you are black or Asian. The gap between average pay for white workers and those from ethnic minorities has actually increased over recent years despite an improvement in social attitudes. Over half of young black men are unemployed, more than double the unemployment rate for young white men.\u00b6 In the US the situation is even starker. While deep-rooted racism remains there has also been an improvement in social attitudes. There has been the development of a black middle class and even a small black elite. Both processes are reflected in the election of a black man as US president. The vast majority of the black population, however, remain among the poorest and most oppressed in society, facing violent state repression. One hundred and thirty five African Americans were killed by the police in the first half of 2015 alone.\u00b6 Racism does not just stem from individual prejudices but from something more fundamental: the nature of capitalism as it has actually developed. Malcolm X correctly declared that, \u201cyou can't have capitalism without racism\u201d. Capitalism, as Karl Marx famously said, came into being \u201cdripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt\u201d. (Capital, Volume 1, Chapter 31) He was referring, particularly, to the role of slavery in the accumulation of capital. With slavery came the development of all kinds of pseudo-scientific racist theories designed to justify the enslavement of African peoples. Racist ideas were then adapted to justify the colonial oppression of large parts of the world.\u00b6 Capitalism was forced to abandon direct colonial rule as a result of the magnificent revolutionary movements that took place against it. Economic exploitation, however, is more brutal than ever. Two hundred and fifty years ago the gap between the richest and poorest countries was around five to one. Today it is 400 to one. Racism is used to justify this vast gulf and also that black workers are usually among the poorest and most oppressed sections of the working class even in the \u2018rich' countries.\u00b6 Women's oppression\u00b6 Similarly, blatant sexism is no longer acceptable in the way it would have been in the past, particularly in the economically advanced capitalist countries. Women have won greater rights in recent decades. There are different factors that have led to this, including the development of improved and widely available contraception. However, many of these gains can be traced back to the growing confidence of women as a result of many more women working rather than being isolated in the home.\u00b6 Nonetheless, women continue to be oppressed. This oppression stems, not merely from the attitudes of men, but from the role of women and the family in capitalist and earlier class societies. Most of us think of \u2018the family' as the individuals who make up our own family, who are often the people who are closest to us. Historically, however, the family as an institution has also acted within class societies as an agent of social control with the father as \u2018head of the household' having responsibility for disciplining women and children. While this concept has been weakened in the modern era by the growing confidence of women, it is far from eliminated. The idea remains deeply ingrained that women are possessions of men and that we need to be loyal and obedient to our partners, and that violence and coercion are acceptable means for men to achieve that, both towards \u2018their' women and \u2018their' children.\u00b6 It is no longer socially acceptable to openly state that women are the possessions of men, yet these ideas were enshrined in law until relatively recently. Marital rape only became illegal in Britain in 1991, Spain in 1992, and Germany in 1997. While no longer legal or openly acceptable, marital rape is still widespread and rarely punished. It is estimated that in Britain only 15% of all rapes are reported to the police, and only 7% of those result in conviction. According to the UN, of all the women killed globally in 2012 almost half were killed by their partners or family members. In contrast, only 6% of killings with male victims were committed by intimate partners or family members.\u00b6 At the same time, women continue to bear the brunt of domestic responsibilities despite increasingly also going out to work. In many cases women are still, as the Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky put it, the \u2018slaves of slaves'. While in Britain, for example, most studies show men accepting that they should do an equal amount of domestic chores as women, there is still a considerable gap between intentions and reality. One survey showed that on average women did 17 hours a week of domestic chores (excluding childcare) whereas men did less than six.\u00b6 It is true, therefore, that men get some gain from women's disproportionate bearing of the domestic burden, in having a few more hours leisure time. The main gain, however, is for capitalism. By putting the main burden of domestic life, the bringing up of the next generation (from which the future workforce is drawn), and caring for the sick and elderly on women, they are removed from the responsibility of society as a whole.\u00b6 Power concentrated in the capitalist class\u00b6 To suggest that power is not concentrated in one class is to completely misunderstand the nature of capitalism. Today, wealth and power is concentrated in fewer hands \u2013 the owners of the major banks and corporations \u2013 even than when Marx was writing. According to Oxfam, the richest 85 people on earth \u2013 a double-decker bus full \u2013 have as much wealth as the poorest half of the world's population. The richest 85 include five women and one African, although white men predominate. Their role in society, however, does not stem primarily from their colour or gender but that they are part of a tiny super-wealthy ruling elite.\u00b6 The world's 100 biggest companies now control 70% of global trade. Even if their boards of directors included many more black people or women it would not make any material difference to the exploitation suffered by the working class and poor worldwide, not least black women. Look at South Africa, where the incorporation of a tiny minority of blacks into the capitalist class has made no difference to the dire poverty suffered by the majority. And capitalism is increasingly incapable of taking society forward. Many of the rights partially taken for granted by previous generations in Europe, like a relatively secure job, home and pension, are now things of the past.\u00b6 To say that social relations in modern society are capitalist relations is not to take an \u2018economic determinist' view of society: arguing that every aspect of the \u2018superstructure' of society \u2013 the state, politics, culture, social attitudes and so on \u2013 are rigidly determined by the character of the economy. On the contrary, there is an inter-relationship between the two. At the same time, politics and social attitudes reflect not only the current character of capitalism but also remnants of the past and \u2013 particularly in mass struggles of the working class and the oppressed \u2013 the seeds of a potential better future. Nonetheless, it is clear that as long as we live in a capitalist society, where wealth and power rests with the tiny elite who own and control industry, science and technology, then the superstructure of that society will also ultimately reflect and act in the interests of that ruling elite.\u00b6 No amount of demanding that people \u2018check their privilege' will eliminate social attitudes generated and sustained by capitalism. While determined mass struggle can force capitalism to adapt to a certain extent \u2013 as has been the case with LGBT rights, equal pay legislation and other measures \u2013 permanent and deep-rooted change, particularly where it threatens the functioning of capitalism, will only be achieved by the socialist transformation of society.\u00b6 The horrific bureaucratic degeneration and then collapse of the Soviet Union have obscured the importance of the Russian revolution in giving a glimpse of what socialism would mean for those suffering oppression. In Russia in 1917 the working class led a movement of the oppressed which successfully overthrew capitalism for the first, and so far, the only time. Russia's extreme poverty and the isolation of the new workers' state led to its degeneration. Nonetheless, in the early days it gave a glimpse of how a new society could overcome oppressions that had existed for millennia.\u00b6 In \u2018backward' Russia, legal changes were introduced very quickly which were many decades ahead of any capitalist country. These included universal suffrage, civil marriage and divorce when requested by either partner, equal pay, paid maternity leave, the right to abortion and the legalisation of homosexuality. Oppressed nationalities were given the genuine right to self-determination. Measures were taken to encourage nationalities and cultures oppressed under tsarism, including the development of a written form of some languages for the first time.\u00b6 Of course, legal or formal measures do not in themselves end oppression. Decades after the passing of equal pay legislation in Britain, for example, women still earn an average of \u00a35,000 a year less than men. Addressing women's oppression in the Soviet Union, Trotsky described how legal equality was a step forward but actual equality in social relations required a far more \u201cdeep-going plough\u201d, capable of providing real economic equality and lifting the domestic burden from women, and transforming social attitudes ingrained over millennia. A whole number of measures began to be introduced in the aftermath of the Russian revolution (including free childcare, communal restaurants and public laundries) which, while never fully implemented due to the degeneration of the Soviet Union, gave a glimpse of how the domestic burden could be lifted. That, in turn, could have laid the foundations for the building of a society based on women's equality.\u00b6 Many intersectionalists put very little emphasis on campaigning for economic and practical measures to lift the burden on women, instead concentrating overwhelmingly on social attitudes, and trying to create spaces within society that are free of oppression. Yet freeing women from the heavy load of being the carers, cooks and cleaners for the whole of society is an essential prerequisite for ending women's oppression. Twenty-first century capitalism, far from taking steps towards this, is driving in the opposite direction.\u00b6 Austerity affects women severely. It includes huge cuts in public services that partially lifted some of the responsibilities that fall on women. David Cameron's big society could be summed up as demanding that women compensate for the cuts to health, child and elderly care by taking the burden on themselves. This is a demonstration that under capitalism, even where oppressed groups make gains, they are never guaranteed to be permanent. This also applies to the devastating, sometimes life-threatening, consequences of austerity for disabled people.\u00b6 Combating prejudice\u00b6 Pointing out the need for fundamental change in society does not in any way downgrade the importance of combating oppressive and reactionary ideas and practices while we live in this society, including within the workers' movement. However, this will by necessity be a constant battle. Intersectionalists call for \u2018safe spaces' with zero tolerance for anything considered an oppressive view. But it is utopian to try and create a safe space which is sealed off from the society in which we all live and are affected by. Turning inwards in order to concentrate on doing so \u2013 rather than turning out to build a movement capable of winning real change \u2013 is doomed to frustration and failure. Far from creating safe spaces, this can often lead to an undemocratic environment, where the individuals dominant in a particular \u2018space' assert that they feel oppressed by ideas and opinions they disagree with.\u00b6 There is also a dangerous tendency to suggest that the value of someone's contribution to a discussion should be based primarily on what oppressions they as an individual suffer from. This is completely false. Britain's first and only female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, undoubtedly suffered individual oppression as a woman, but the neo-liberal programme she drove through was completely against the interests of working-class women. Recently, Jeremy Corbyn, the new left leader of the Labour Party, has been attacked supposedly for not having enough women in his shadow cabinet, although his front bench is the first that has been majority women. More women voted for Corbyn than for the other right-wing candidates (two of whom were women) in the leadership election because he stood against austerity. Had he chosen a pro-austerity woman as shadow chancellor rather than the left MP, John McDonnell, most of the women who voted for him would have correctly been deeply disappointed.\u00b6 The issue of safe spaces also relates to intersectionalists' views on gender: that the concept of two genders is a social construct and, in reality, gender is more like a spectrum. Emphasis is often put on supporting transgender people and all those who rebel against societal gender constraints. This includes some who do not identify as either male or female but as \u2018gender-non-conforming'. This reflects a positive rejection of current gender relations and homophobia by a growing number of young people. Socialists, of course, support the democratic right of individuals to define both their own gender and sexuality. However, while there is radicalisation among an important layer on this issue, that does not mean it is possible to create, as some intersectionalists attempt, spaces within capitalist society completely free from societal pressures regarding gender.\u00b6 Capitalism shapes the outlook of all of us from the time we are born, with all of the distortions of the human personality that creates. This includes how we are expected to behave appropriately for our given gender. It is not possible to fully escape this; in this society capitalist gender roles are an objective reality. Even rejecting capitalist gender norms means reacting to, and therefore being affected by, those norms. It is not possible to prescribe exactly how human relations, including the role of gender, would flower in the future when freed from the rigid straitjackets imposed by capitalism.\u00b6 The role of the working class\u00b6 The crucial issue for anyone determined to end oppression, therefore, is how to end capitalism and begin to build a world that is free of oppression: a \u2018safe space' for all. Today, just as when Marx described the working class as the \u2018grave digger of capitalism', it is the key force on the planet capable of ridding us of this bankrupt system. Both privilege theory and intersectionality would list social class \u2013 what they would describe as \u2018classism' \u2013 as one form of oppression. However, it features as one item on a list and is often discussed in terms of the prejudice people face because of having a working-class accent or postcode. The centrality of class in the structure of society is not recognised. The basic idea that a Nigerian worker would have more in common with a worker in Britain or the US than they would with Aliko Dangote, the only African to make it on to the list of the richest 85 on the planet, would not be understood. The fact that it is the working class that is ultimately responsible for the creation of the capitalists' profits and that by collective action it is capable of bringing capitalist society to a halt is discounted as outmoded.\u00b6 Yet the working class is not \u2018disappearing'. In fact, it is potentially stronger today than it was at the time of the Russian Revolution. Many countries where workers were a tiny minority of society a century ago now have large and powerful working classes. In the economically advanced countries, like Britain, deindustrialisation has meant that the industrial working class is much smaller. However, there still remain groups of workers with enormous power to bring society a halt when they strike \u2013 anyone who lives in London and witnessed the recent London Underground strikes knows that. Deindustrialisation has not led to young people becoming \u2018middle class', but has forced them into low paid, temporary work, often in the service sector. At the same time, large sections of the population \u2013 including teachers and civil servants \u2013 who would have previously considered themselves middle class have been driven down into the ranks of the working class in their living conditions and social outlook.\u00b6 The history of the 20th century repeatedly demonstrated the preparedness of working-class people to fight for socialism. However, it also demonstrated that the capitalist class does all it can to cling to power, not least by attempting to divide and rule by turning different sections of the working class against each other.\u00b6 In recent years, there has been increasing radicalisation and struggle globally, including revolutionary movements. Out of these, largely unsuccessful, struggles conclusions will begin to be drawn about what is necessary to change society. That requires a mass revolutionary movement, bringing together different sections of the working class \u2013 with different experiences and outlooks \u2013 in a mass party with a clear programme and a determined and accountable leadership.\u00b6 Such a party would not be a model of a new society, but a tool to bring it about. Nonetheless, it is crucial that such a mass party would include in its ranks all of the most oppressed sections of the working class and that it is a vibrant and democratic force in which all participants feel able to express their views. Its programme, as was the case with the Bolsheviks in Russia, has to fight for the rights not just of the working class in general but also for different specifically oppressed groups.\u00b6 Undoubtedly, such a movement would also win the support of wide sections of the middle class and even individuals from the capitalist class who saw the need for a break with capitalism. This would particularly include those who suffer oppression under capitalism and who recognise that the only way to end homophobia, racism or women's oppression is to join the struggle for a new society.\u00b6 Struggle itself unifies\u00b6 It would be ludicrous and deplorable to argue that those fighting their particular oppression should hold back and \u2018wait' for a unified struggle of the whole working class. Mass struggle is a thousand times more effective than exhortations to individuals to change their attitudes in winning social progress. It is always the case that a movement has a greater chance of success if it is able to reach out to other sections of the working class, and that therefore it is important that the programme put forward by a particular movement attempts to do this. However, that is in no way to suggest that any group should artificially delaying fighting back until they, for example, convince more white or male workers of their cause.\u00b6 Nonetheless, to permanently end racism in the US, for instance, will require ending capitalism and will therefore have to involve a struggle uniting different sections of the working class \u2013 black, Hispanic, Asian and white. This is a practical question. The African American population, who suffer the worst police racism, are 13% of the population and will not be able to win alone. The capitalist class will try to increase divisions between different sections of the oppressed, particularly at times of heightened struggle. The oppressed need to increase their strength by trying to maximise unity. The $15 Now movement in the US, and the election of Socialist Alternative member Kshama Sawant in Seattle, give a glimpse of the growing possibilities in the US to build a united workers' movement.\u00b6 Achieving unity does not mean downplaying the importance of combating the specific oppressions different groups in society face. On the contrary, it is vital that socialists campaign for the workers' movement to fight to take up every aspect of oppression. The Socialist Party has a proud history of doing this \u2013 for example, spearheading the Campaign Against Domestic Violence in the 1990s which was central to getting the trade unions to take the issue up.\u00b6 Intersectionality on university campuses in Britain has had a tendency to turn campus feminist societies inwards, focusing on a fruitless attempt to grade degrees of oppression rather than fighting to end it. However, many of those initially attracted to these ideas are searching for a way to change society and will quickly come up against the limits of identity politics in all its forms.\u00b6 One small indication of this is the popularity among young people of the film Pride, which tells the true story of Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners (LGSM). LGSM recognised the common ground between their struggle against the Tories and that of the 1984/85 miners' strike. Their attempt to support the miners was not without difficulties \u2013 with prejudices on both sides \u2013 but ultimately forged a real unity. LGSM understood that a victory for the miners would have been a massive defeat for Thatcher, the Tories and the capitalist class \u2013 and that was in the interests of LGBT people. They never once responded to white, straight miners, who were often initially homophobic, by telling them to \u2018check their privilege'. One result of their heroic efforts was big parts of the workers' movement wholeheartedly taking up the struggle for LGBT liberation, including National Union of Mineworkers lodges from across the country leading the 1985 Pride demonstration.\u00b6 The miners' strike was a major event in the class struggle in Britain, but it will be dwarfed by events that will take place in the future against the background of a crisis-ridden capitalism trying to drive the living standards of the majority into the dirt. For some intersectionalists it will require witnessing the power of the working class in action in order for them to draw the conclusion that the route to ending their specific oppression is not as part of fragmented separate groupings but by throwing their lot in with the class struggle. However, growing numbers of young people, particularly when they become active in concrete struggles, are already being attracted to socialist ideas as the only way to achieve real liberation for all humanity.'"

Secondly, late-modern society's established patterns of consumption are known to be socially exclusive and environmentally destructive. Despite all hopes for ecological modernization and revolutionary improvements in resource ef\ufb01ciency (e.g. Weizsa\u00a8cker et al., 1998; Hawkenet al., 1999; Lomborg, 2001), physical environmental limits imply that the lifestyles and established patterns of consumption cherished by advanced modern societies cannot even be extended to all residents of the richest countries, let alone to the populations of the developing world. For the sake of the (re)construction of an ever elusive Self, in their struggle against self-referentiality and in pursuit of the regeneration of difference, late-modern societies are thus locked into the imperative of maintaining and further developing the principle of exclusion (Blu\u00a8hdorn, 2002, 2003). At any price they have to, and indeed do, defend a lifestyle that requires ever increasing social inequality, environmental degradation, predatory resource wars, and the tight policing of potential internal and external enemies.14 For this effort, military and surveillance technology provide ever more sophisticated and ef\ufb01cient means. Nevertheless, the principle of exclusion is ultimately still unsustainable, not only because of spiralling \u2018security' expenses but also because it directly contradicts the modernist notion of the free and autonomous individual that late-modern society desperately aims to sustain. For this reason, late-modern society is confronted with the task of having to sustain both the late-modern principle of exclusion as well as its opposite, i.e. the modernist principle of inclusion. Very importantly, the con\ufb02ict between the principles of exclusion and inclusion is not simply one between different individuals, political actors or sections of society. Instead, it is a politically irresolvable con\ufb02ict that resides right within the late-modern individual, the late-modern economy and late-modern politics. And if, as Touraine notes, late-modern society no longer believes in nor even desires political transcendence, the particular challenge is that the two principles can also no longer be attributed to different dimensions of time, i.e. the former to the present, and the latter to some future society. Instead, late-modern society needs to represent and reproduce itself and its opposite at the same time.'"

As this is a critical moment to reassess the history and present of international socialism and imagine a new path forward \u2013 many new paths forward \u2013 it is absolutely crucial to get the basics of this reassessment right. Jacobin have done a remarkable job in bringing together a large Internet public from around the world, but especially in the US and Europe, and have offered many strong interventions against the ideology of neoliberal centrism on a variety of issues. They have successfully built up a small, but growing, and quite active socialist public sphere consisting of many who would previously have been apolitical, and for that their efforts must be commended. They also routinely publish a variety of perspectives from within today's international, disparate, and ideologically heterogeneous \u201cLeft\u201d; and so maintain this public sphere through a spirited and necessary debate. And yet, as Jacobin have developed a certain overall line on contemporary politics, and inasmuch as they publicise this line through self-consciously provocative interventions in social media on various issues; sharp, comradely, even polemical critique on this line from a fellow Leftist must surely be welcome. The Jacobin community can only be strengthened when it can face, answer, and grow from serious critiques about its faults and missteps. The ability to listen to good-faith critiques and learn from one's mistakes is central to any successful political movement \u2013 and it is a political movement that Jacobin aims to inspire. It is in this spirit I propose the following thesis. As long as the emergent Jacobin-centred public sphere refuses to seriously engage with what they have derisively termed \u201cidentity\u201d politics, it will alienate the most vital sections of a twenty-first century Marxist coalition and repeat the mistakes made by white socialist movements in the Western core throughout the twentieth century. As I will discuss in the conclusion, both Corbynism in the UK, and the Jacobin-centred public sphere more broadly, have much to gain from a serious engagement with what the latter have derisively termed \u201cidentitarian Leftism\u201d. Foregrounding the histories, victories, and struggles of indigenous, Black, queer, feminist, disabilities, and migrant movements and how they have successfully theorized and contested patriarchal, racial, capitalist, and imperialist hierarchies only deepens a socialist analysis and ensures that the failures of exclusionary, one-dimensional forms of organising are not repeated. I use the term Jacobin-centred public sphere advisedly. The magazine's wide range of published work includes a range of positions on race, gender, and class that can't easily be categorized as being simply for or against identity politics as such. Yet, a sense remains \u2013 one that is substantiated by the tone and the content of strong polemical interventions by Vivek Chibber, Walter Benn Michaels, Nivedita Majumdar, and Adolph Reed - that one story that Jacobin is always ready to tell is the story of the apparent betrayal of class politics by an American \u201cIdentitarian Left\u201d. The Fable of the Non-identitarian and identitarian Left The story goes something like this. There was once a non-identitarian left, a Left in America that emphasized nothing but class, that picked only the right battles and won them. This Left had its heyday in the unionist movements from the 1920s to the 1940s and brought about many of the victories of FDR's New Deal. It had all the strengths of a trade-unionist organization. It was working-class, firm, strong, and decisive. Then starting in the 1960s, with the cultural revolution and the emergence of a theoretically prolix post-modernism, a demonic identity politics emerged fully-formed \u2013 ready to be appropriated by the bourgeoisie and destroy this powerful class-first Left once and for all. These New Leftists got so obsessed with philosophical and literary speculation about cultural oppression that they lost track of the real issues. So keyed into \u2018intersectionality' were these identitarians that vigourous contestation against the boss fell by the wayside. In fact, Michaels suggests, this obsession with identity was a way for these \u2018Leftists' to mask their own complicity with the bourgeois ruling class in its legitimation of a diversified capitalism. These New Leftists retreated to the academy, conjuring up ever more intricate and complex critiques of capitalism without ever offering a clear picture of how to fight it. Chibber adds that the misfortune of \u201csocial theory classes\u201d in the last twenty-five years has been to make Leftists too obsessed with \u201cmargins\u201d, misunderstanding the centrality of the working-class as a revolutionary subject. And so these Jacobin contributors \u2013 often promoted and foregrounded in the Jacobin public sphere - registered their profound intellectual and political disagreement with the post-1960s academic and political Left. Intersectional thought, cultural politics, identity politics, all of these tendencies fragmented a united Left by focusing on the fragments and the margins. They created a Left too theory-minded to understand the bloody realities of capturing power. These elitist \u201cidentitarian\u201d academics and activists, born of the 1960s cultural revolutions, are held responsible for misunderstanding the basics of a Marxist class war and running the \u201cLeft\u201d into a cul-de-sac that they deserve to stay in if they keep insisting on their current modes of thought and action. The role of Jacobin or at least these rather polemical interventions in the Jacobin pages is to bring class back, to make the \u201cLeft\u201d Left again, to make the \u201cLeft\u201d great again; and get us going on the march to working-class victory. White Marxism? The elisions and confusions entailed in this anti-identitarian story go a long way in explaining why in many radical circles Jacobin is now seen, fairly or unfairly, as a white socialist magazine. A magazine intent on erasing all the historic gains made by feminists, Black, and indigenous radical movements in favour of a reductionist, white-centric politics that harks back to a supposed golden age of the 1940s [1]. First of all, words have meaning. When such senior academics and activists as Michaels, Reed, Chibber, and Majumdar go out of their way to single out \u201cintersectionality\u201d, frames of analysis that focuses on the \u201cmargins\u201d, and questions of \u201cidentity\u201d as responsible for the comprehensive abatement of class politics in the American left, they can't but be aware that they are not so subtly pinning the responsibility for this failure on Black feminists. After all, Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw's famous article, on how Black women's experiences of male violence are conditioned by specific intersections of racism and sexism in American society, an analysis then missed in antiracist and feminist debates, was titled \u201cMapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence Against Women of Color\u201d. Intersectionality as a political and intellectual project was developed by Black women scholars and activists to address the simple fact that as Black women, they are materially exploited, excluded, and subject to violence, due to distinct hierarchical structures that are largely ignored by a white, patriarchal, and racial capitalist society. In fighting and naming this oppression, they necessarily had to complicate easy unities of a given working-class identity, or even a unified Black experience to lay out precisely how patriarchal violence and racial capitalism affected Black women distinctly from how it affected white men, how it exploited Black working-class women differently from how it exploited white working-class men. If one reads anything in the Black feminist canon, such as books and articles by Audre Lorde, bell hooks, Angela Davis, Patricia Hill Collins, or Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, and this is not mentioning the hundreds of thousands of other scholars and activists who continue this work, one can scarcely get a sense that they are uninterested in class or have backgrounded capitalism and class politics for a simplistic \u201cidentitarianism\u201d. One wonders if those who propound this anti-Identitarian line have actually read a word of Black feminist literature at all. Idealist Fables Second, this anti-Identitarian fable is a profoundly idealist, and as such is an anti-Marxist, analysis of the history of the last sixty years. It presumes that the battle between labour and capital was won entirely by capital in the academies of the Western core. In this story, somehow simultaneously, Stuart Hall, Selma James, Silvia Federici, Robin D. G. Kelley, Judith Butler, and scores of other leading Leftists around the world nefariously invented post-modernism to fit the ideological requirements of neoliberalism and thus convinced their many students to stop fighting capital and instead take up fighting endless social media wars about culture and popular representations of identity. The contempt one must have for feminists' essential work on describing the mutual imbrication of patriarchy and capitalism \u2013 of the central role of gender in capitalist society's division of labour and its extraction of surplus value by rendering childcare and housework unpaid \u2013 to make this case is startling. On the one hand, the story completely misses the foundational new insights and frameworks that so many Marxists in so many different spaces and countries developed in understanding the racial, gendered, and imperial dimensions of modern capitalism. Dimensions that actively hinder worker-solidarity and worker-leadership and that must be understood to sustain any successful revolutionary politics. On the other hand, it deeply misunderstands the history of the post-1960s class struggle. Neoliberalism didn't win because post-modernism hypnotized the Western core's middle classes into somnolence. Neoliberalism won because the ruling classes fought and fought with the might of the state. Neoliberalism also won because the social-democratic parties that the middle-classes of the Western core continued to vote for essentially gave up on their working-class constituencies. Social-democratic parties that were supported by unions representing a labour aristocracy more interested in maintaining a nationalist class compromise with large firms than challenging the racial, gendered, and imperialist relations of expropriation which sustained Western economic growth. In the US, the Democratic party went on to break unions, retrenched the welfare state, perpetuated a racial backlash to Black power in the 1960s in the form of brutal mass incarceration, and undertook permanent war in the political-economic peripheries to shore up imperial value-chains. The very scholars and organizers who most astutely theorized, identified and enacted important acts of rebellion to halt the advance of heterosexist patriarchal imperialist capitalism \u2013 as bell hooks puts it - come under fire from Jacobin radicals for missing class altogether. The Freedom to make inconvenient Arguments? Now, those in the Jacobin public sphere who hold these views have responded to these critiques in two ways. One, they say that all the people named above are people of colour, and so to critique these academics as perpetuating a \u201cwhite socialism\u201d is to erase their identity and thus perpetuate a new form of erasure of POC views that are apparently \u201cinconvenient\u201d for most radicals. This is a bad-faith critique, because if the Jacobin public-sphere is against the confusions of identity politics altogether, then why put forward the identities of these scholars as relevant to the discussion at all? Presumably, this is to get at the arbitrariness and meaningless of one's identity positions in trying to explain one's political positions, and that a clean line cannot be drawn from the former to the latter. That to describe a person of colour's political analysis as \u201cwhite\u201d is to deny them the freedom to make inconvenient arguments. But if race, gender, and empire are central dimensions of contemporary capitalist exploitation, and we have seen above a series of writers who seem interested in minimizing these dimensions for a nationalist class-first analysis; the consequences of such an analysis are that by being blind to how class itself is racialized and gendered, it would fail to question the very hierarchies people of colour and feminists are trying to fight. Second, some in the Jacobin public sphere respond by lumping together feminists on the radical left and radical people of colour who make these substantial critiques with centrists and contemporary neoliberals who have weaponised a superficial politics of representation as a single, all-powerful group: the Identitarian left. Once again, any knowledge of the history of the Black, feminist, and LGBTQ movements in the US will yield the simple fact that they have been and continue to be heavily contested between liberal reformist and radical Marxist currents - among many others - and that no generalization can be made about these large mobilizations as inherently neo-liberal. These puzzling arguments merely heighten the sense that such anti-identitarian critiques are woefully under-theorised and are perhaps made to incite controversy and anger more than thought and action. The fact of the matter is that Jacobin's politics are already intersectional to some degree. That they consistently foreground the work of leading scholars and activists from all of the \u201cidentitarian\u201d movements suggests that they implicitly presuppose the radical victories that identity politics has won for the radical Left: the inclusion of women, people of colour, indigenous people, lesbian, gay, trans and queer people, and a principled international solidarity with anti-imperialist struggles around the world at the heart of radical politics. There seems to be no need to prosecute this clumsy culture-war against such a poorly defined identitarianism per se, especially one that pointedly appears to erase the significant contributions that Black feminists have made in theorizing and organizing large communities against neoliberalism; most recently in leading the Movement for Black Lives and bringing forward prison abolition as a central struggle in the fight against racial capitalism. Words have meaning, and they have consequences. Continuing to deplore \u201cthe margins\u201d as a frame of analysis and insisting on an imagined working-class unity will only continue to antagonize those on the Left who have long been organizing against patriarchal imperialist racial capitalism and will continue to do so, with or without certain Jacobin contributors' seal of approval on the effectiveness of their politics. Practical Consequences What are some other practical consequences of this line of analysis? One, it is perniciously false on its own terms and refuses to engage seriously with radical queer, feminist, Black, and internationalist political movements that have continued to contest patriarchal racial capitalism in the last forty years: from forcing American civil society, the state, insurance, and pharmaceutical industries to address the treatment of HIV/AIDS, to materially denting the ability of Israel to carry out business and promote apologia for its apartheid regime around the world, to building coalitions with prisoners that bring together violently policed working-class Black and Latino communities in deindustrialized cities (as Ruth Wilson Gilmore documents in \u201cGolden Gulag\u201d). Indeed, the recent legislative victory of forcing Republican senators to vote against their own healthcare bill was secured to a large extent by the courage and steadfast mobilization of disability rights campaigners in the past year. Through personal testimonies and consistently disruptive direct action, they have made it clear that Trump's healthcare bill is going to kill them; that their illnesses incur medical costs which they are not able to pay, that the rise in insurance premiums will be fatal. The lens of disability and race forcing us to confront the fact that capitalist healthcare is eugenics. If one tries to explain these victories as either identitarian reformism on the one hand, or inadequate grasps at class struggle on the other; one misses the significantly novel ways in which they have helped form radical communities that make a working-class rather than presume one. Finally, in failing to be internationalist, this kind of class-first analysis \u2013 one which relies on a notion of an accepted common sense which any socialist politics should effectively mobilize (a notion usefully criticized in this piece in New Socialist) fails to challenge pervasive white-supremacist and bourgeois ideas about who it is that constitutes a worker, and who a foreign parasite, who it is that can govern themselves and who needs to be policed, or deported. The temptation to mobilize what appears so obviously \u201cworking-class angst\u201d without interrogating how it is racialized and gendered or whether the targets are capitalists and not migrant workers is something UK Labour has consistently struggled with before and during the era of Blairism. In recent comments, Jeremy Corbyn offered a plainly false argument that it was the \u201cwholesale importation\u201d of Central European workers which destroyed labour conditions in the construction industry. As Maya Goodfellow argues here, migration doesn't bring down wages, union-busting does. Further, Corbyn's comments, like much discussion around Brexit, made no mention of non-EU nationals: Asian and African migrants living in the UK. Support for Leave and more broadly, support for \u201ccontrols on immigration\u201d is to a measurable degree driven by racial animus towards non-European migrants. A socialist Labour movement must respond by challenging these sentiments on the level of ideology and putting forth a clear legislative agenda for abolishing Theresa May's (and Tony Blair's) brutal Home Office and its ICE-like incarceration and deportation regime. Engaging meaningfully with disabilities-rights, queer, feminist, Black, indigenous, and migrant struggles ensures that these lazy concessions to a racist, capitalist common sense don't happen. Further, as Corbyn has exemplarily demonstrated in his parliamentary career, in a way that Jacobin has often been equivocal, to say the least, foregrounding the history and present of American and European empire in invading and impoverishing Caribbean, Latin American, Asian, and African nations is absolutely essential to ensure that socialism in the core that does not rest content as a socialism for the core. Going forward, Corbynism, and the American socialists inspired by Jacobin, will only grow from a pluralist commitment to these multiple fronts. Corbynism can be a vital force in dismantling the imperialist ideological and economic structures sustaining British political economy and culture: for instance, by instituting reparations to the many countries in the Third World for the country's crimes.'"

Statements by President Trump suggesting a willingness to use nuclear weapons first in a crisis with North Korea has exacerbated the risks of accidental nuclear escalation. But in even calmer times, such vague threats are ill advised. For example, US officials apparently believe that repeatedly stating or demonstrating America's willingness and ability to use nuclear weapons in response to many kinds of nonnuclear threats can be reassuring. Japan might imagine that references to nuclear weapons use, such as an American president announcing that \u201call options are on the table\u201d in response to nonnuclear options might deter China or North Korea from initiating a conventional attack and make war less likely. But China and North Korea are well aware that the US has nuclear weapons; there is no need to make explicit threats. Anything that would be interpreted by them \u2013 or by Japan \u2013 as a direct commitment to make a nuclear threat in response to anything but the use of nuclear weapons create what has been called \u201ca commitment trap\u201d (Sagan, 2000). In these cases, the United States and Japan may feel compelled to follow through with a nuclear response, even if they believe it was unwise and might trigger a catastrophic an otherwise avoidable response. If we are fighting and likely to prevail in a conventional war on the Korean peninsula, using nuclear weapons could lead to a move devastating nuclear attack by the North on South Korea and stalemate any conventional conflict. Yet, failing to respond could expose past commitments to use nuclear weapons as a bluff and the call into question the credibility of the United States on all security and military matters.'"

India's NFU has been harshly criticized internally by hawkish politicians and military leaders since it was announced in 2003, given that Pakistan has made the first use of nuclear weapons a key element of its security strategy. Some analysts believe the Modi government may abandon no first use sooner or later (Dalton Citation2019). Nevertheless, both China and India have promoted a GNFU, though the proposal has gone largely ignored by the other nuclear-armed states.

In addition, Russia retains substantial defensive capabilities of its own, particularly its nuclear deterrent, which should minimize fears that the relatively modest NATO posture enhancements currently in progress would be used for direct aggression against Russian territory in the near term.'"

This violence bespeaks the fundamental relationship between Black Women and the state and the society: whether the perpetrator is known or unknown, an agent of the state, an intimate partner, or the state itself.15 The point of attending to these cases is not to make a spectacle of them but to remember what has compelled armed resistance by Black Women against the pathologists and forensic scientists and policing agents who continually designate state [End Page 262] murder of Black people with the vocabulary of \"within policy,\" \"no human involved,\" and \"good kill.\" Under such regimes of brute force, everything is \"within policy.\" The silence about these murders in custody, in addition to the murders themselves points to the basic incorporation of the practices of the medical plantation on the enslaved into everyday life\u2014and the significance of slave status passing through the line of the mother. These murders bespeak a process of normalizing this violence and suturing it to the good work of life-extending and social order-protecting state. Taking Kenyon Farrow's pleading and caution that progressive Black people attend to: 1) state violence and also intramural violence and, 2) the ways that carcerality operates across institutions with special attention to the medical health industries, I find increasingly that taking the lessons from critical approaches to the study of race and medicine in society opens up how we approach murders of Black Women in custody.16 The study of gender inequality in political science needs a history of \"biomedical racialization,\"17 the medical plantation, and the surveillance and policing of Black female bodies to theorize an entire discursive world sustained by grief and subjection. These cases are exemplary of the pervasive idea that Black Women are disposable and that whatever injury is done to them serves some necessary and legitimized part of the gender-racial-sexual logic of social order. Such totalizing conditions have drawn activists into the street, onto highways, into fearless physical confrontations, and with the state. This is the world that conjures contemporary collective action against gender inequality, a world that each of us needs to theorize, mobilize against\u2026 and ultimately destroy. Though, some of us can afford to jest about \"polishing our hoe,\" or other such tools of self-defense, others of us keep it sharpened and always at the ready. The Slave Polity and the Combahee River Collective There is a political history to be excavated that will help us theorize the relative silence about and acceptance of murders of Black Women in custody today. I have turned to the history of the Combahee River Collective (1970s-1980s), a Boston activist black feminist lesbian movement organization, and the extraordinary and yet fairly normalized violence against Black Women that was part of what the collective was founded to address. \u2026 a serial killer killing scores of Black Women and a media blackout\u2014coordinated censorship\u2014about these deaths not being politically relevant or newsworthy. Barbara Smith and the other members of the Combahee River Collective conducted a sustained political theoretical analysis of these women's lives and the social meaning of their deaths (and the only formal investigation worthy of that name) published in two 1979 pamphlets entitled, \"Six Black Women: Why Did They Die?\" and its updated companion pamphlet [End Page 263] entitled, \"Eleven Black Women: Why Did They Die?\"18 In 1979, there was a serial killer on the loose in Boston, somebody who probably had a job every day and worked in the civil service, or in some industry, or the private sector, or higher education. Some civilian behaving as a guardian of an anti-Black woman civil society, tortured and killed Black Women because he could. Or perhaps there were multiple serial killers on the loose\u2014or a group. Because the state and society that benefited from these murders and the myths that they propped up did not undertake to view them as an aberration worthy of attention or exploration, the main reason that we know about their existence is because the members of the Combahee River Collective dedicated themselves to bringing attention to these women's lives. I am arguing that Black Women were murdered sans proper investigation in their time and in our own because the long history of the medical plantation, medical discrimination, scientific experimentation, and medical Jim Crow pre-disposed the U.S. population to view Black Women as everything but objects of human sympathy.19 While best well known for their Black Feminist Statement (1977) that challenged the erasure of racialized gender consciousness from movements that could not have existed without their intersectional approach, the Combahee River Collective theorized about these murders by rooting them in Black Women's positionality in the political order of modernity's slave polity. By slave polity I mean the uniquely modern slave polity that passed slave status on from generation to generation through the line of the mother and that reinforced slave status through normalized breeding of Black Women for sexualized punishment to extend the life of the whitened political order. This slave polity also relied on painful human experimentation on Black Women and their reproductive organs thereby doubly sexualizing the non-consensual extraction of new knowledge and new science on their bodies. Consideration of the history of violence against Black Women under slavery goes a very long way in helping us understand how we have arrived at the present moment. After three years of meeting as a collective to clarify their political analysis of the paradigmatic \"fissures of race, class, and gender in deindustrializing America\" and drawing from a \"web of local movements\" the Combahee River Collective members wrote passionately about these multiple and interlocking political projects\u2014from polite to coarse\u2014that sought to make them into prey.20 And they reminded the world that they were armed to the teeth just as that Black woman general, Harriet Tubman, a century before them had been. That group of late 20th century women named themselves \"The Combahee River Collective\" after a late 19th century military battle against the essential paradox of the Americas\u2014the New World's contribution to civilization\u2014the slave polity and freedom negotiated through normalized [End Page 264] and sexualized violence enacted on Black Women's bodies. Such violence produced notions of freedom but also produced and legitimated scientific regimes and forms of medicalization that were associated with extending life for some regardless of the cost for Black Women themselves. The Motive Force of Institutional Life and Civil Society In the following I turn to a few nested examples of the conditions that animated the Combahee River Collective's attention to state, vigilante, and interpersonal violence against Black Women. My examples come from a narrowly tailored examination of the history of scientifically applied management21 of sexual violence on the medical plantation during slavery, (The Anarcha Project, 2006/7) and after (Austin Clarke's The Polished Hoe, 2002, and the Black Lives Matter Movement). While The Anarcha Project22 is the definitive historical-artistic case for describing the ideology of the medical plantation and the uses of Black Women's bodies in slavery, scholars of the legacies of slavery as an institution, practice, set of legal codes, and a cultural logic emphatically contend that the \"afterlife of slavery\"23 and \"post slavery subjects\"24 continue to provide robust meaning making about the status of Black Women and the continued use of scientifically applied routinized sexualized violence. Such works point to the sublime ghosts haunting the question of the murders of Black Women in custody, today. These examples are relevant because such systematic violence reflects the fundamental relationship between Black Women and the state and the society: whether the perpetrator is known or unknown, an agent of the state, an intimate partner, or the state itself. These histories of continued and systematic abuse against Black Women served as a unifying force and focus of the many different movements that the women in Combahee brought to their writing and advocacy. This history of violence explains their political commitment to a \"shared belief that Black Women are inherently valuable, that our liberation is a necessity not as an adjunct to somebody else's\" and the revolutionary possibility in such claims.25 Not defenseless. Not easy prey. Not willing to surrender. Their attention to the \"healthy love for ourselves, our sisters and our community\" that they considered to be the foundational response to the structural forces that stalked them was revolutionary.26 The Combahee River Collective demonstrated that this violence had to be named, remembered, and forcefully rebuked especially in the face of myriad structural causes that enabled and even urged an individual or group of individuals to kill Black Women and allow them to get away with it. These structural causes include myths about Black Women as unrapeable, super-human, unable to feel pain, and how the \"possibilities of their wombs\u2026the speculative value of a reproducing [End Page 265] labor force\" the wealth for Empire that could be carved out of their wombs, and their capacities for social reproduction are the motive force of institutional life and civil society.27 All reflect the notion that Black Women have been deemed appropriate objects for socialized, communal, and ritualized acts of state-edifying violence. The Combahee River Collective denounced the silence about the Boston serial killer because the silence about these murders in addition to the murders themselves pointed to basic incorporation of the practices and epistemologies of the medical plantation into everyday life. Mythologies about the imaginary capacities of the \"Black body in pain\" and \"the Black body super-human\" are central to the cultural ideologies and norms that undergird racialized medical discrimination and the sexualized violence that extends into civil society and social life through the extermination of Black Women and their reduction to mere use value. In fact, we might even argue that the social reproduction of a whitened civil society, one that continually and progressively secures substantive rights and actual liberties for white and non-Black people, relies heavily on formal and informal practices of sexualized violence against Black Women. Scholars have increasingly turned to the language of the \"medical plantation\" and its descendant \"medical Jim Crow\" to explain the proliferation of segregation and coerced medical experimentation in state-funded medical facilities for Black patients. The medical plantation was a type of plantation whose enslaved inhabitants were made available to medical researchers as models for the study of human (that is white and non-Black) biology. Health activists like W. Montague Cobb (1904\u20131990), head of the NAACP National Health Committee and Editor of the Journal of the National Medical Association organized a major plank of the long civil rights movement focused exclusively on that dimension of the afterlife of slavery that is more commonly known as medical discrimination. It was these health activists who organized with North Carolina medical personnel to successfully challenge segregation in state-funded medical facilities in the 1963 landmark case, Simkins vs. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital. Like activists in the Black Women's Health Project28 based in Georgia and Florida just a few years later in 1984, central questions of reproduction have to do with whether, when, or if such persons would or could shoulder the weight of themselves, their families, their histories, and their memories in a world in which structural forms of violence (those forms of violence which allegedly have no origins) directed in peculiar and lasting ways at them would never even be named, mentioned, or alluded to except to shame them. These are questions of social reproduction that are basic to Black Women's lives\u2014not the mere making of babies but, the making of black female lives that can be lived or as the collective members explained \"which allows us to continue our struggle and work. [End Page 266] 29 Such myths about the black body not being able to experience pain are reproduced as a matter of course, and as an expression of the afterlife of slavery in the Americas. The existence of social structures and slave polities that attempted to inaugurate the New World through emancipation doctrines that enshrined the particular role of Black Women as antithetical and antagonistic to the production of naturalizable or usable citizens has threaded such myths into Western and Eurocentric practices and institutions. In addition to prospecting in the territory of black reproductivity, discrimination against Black people was masked and justified through allegations about Black sexual and gender perversions and a culture that was deemed pathologically non-heteronormative and non-homonormative.30 In fact the project of gender has been an all out war on Black bodies meaning that attempts to even talk about how sexualized and normalized violence marks us into social categories leaves us with categories whose textures and meanings are typically ill-fitting, useless, and that prohibit clear discussion about what happened, who did it, and what that means in relation to other black bodies. Thus, \"[m]erely naming the pejorative stereotypes attributed to Black Women (e.g. mammy, matriarch, Sapphire, whore, bulldagger), let alone cataloguing the cruel, often murderous, treatment we receive, indicates how little value has been placed upon our lives during four centuries of bondage in the Western hemisphere.\"31 Despite their exhaustive advocacy and research we don't know very much of the details of these Boston 1979 cases exactly because these known structures and myths conspire together and with us to make remembrance of the violence against Black Women deadly and allegedly impossible. Combahee River Collective members pointed to these conditions declaring in their multi-issue and profoundly complex articulation of the term \"identity politics\": that the most profound and potentially most radical politics come directly out of our own identity, as opposed to working to end somebody else's oppression\u2026because it is obvious from looking at all the political movements that have preceded us that anyone is more worthy of liberation than ourselves.32 In a subtle though pregnant critique of having served as the literal, symbolic, and psychic engine for countless reiterations of abolitionist democracy with these words they leveled a hard-hitting critique at those structures of violence that lurk within the political projects of alleged allies. This did not mean that they stopped working against all the different forms of structural violence that worked together to enact the world. But, it did mean that they unapologetically evaluated their own position. [End Page 267] For some, the ontological value of Black Women's bodies\u2014drained of life\u2014is not to be found in their breathing and moving and rejection and survival of such conditions, but rather lies in their reduction to broken flesh, to scientific accounts of how the body responds under this particular stress or that particular strain. For example, this particular killer of Black Women in Boston in the early 1970s, like other killers of Black Women in the same decade, was stalking them without fear of sanction, simply replicating a general social order in which the death of Black Women was not even noteworthy by the larger society. But, for others, also invested in the ontological value of Black Women's bodies, but from a different perspective, the existence of this group of Black and Puerto Rican women who remembered and made explicitly political each and every name of a Black Woman slaughtered\u2014in spite of the terror that this remembering inspired\u2014explains the ontological value of Black Women's bodies. Their practice of remembering and insisting on teaching self-defense in order that Black Women would live suggests that Black Women's bodies had some other meanings altogether, a consciousness unto and about themselves; a consciousness that shores up the \"psychic stability of the world.\"33 The Combahee River Collective and their efforts to seek justice for those murdered women in Boston attested to the ongoing commitment to \"the movement against the slave trade, the abolitionist movement, the feminist movement, the labor movement\u2026the need for a unified effort and the value of a vision of a society substantially better than the existing one.\"34 Their will to name the horror of this violence and to marshal a centuries-long toolkit of organized collective action and militant response by Black Women in the Americas to fight against enduring violence is another ontological fact, an oppositional and revolutionary fact about the meaning of Black Women's bodies that insists on being reckoned with. These women used the \"Black liberation struggle rather than the American Dream as their yardstick, their gauge, their vantage point\" and used \"working papers as part of their discipline, part of their effort to be clear, analytical, personal, basic: part of their efforts to piece together an\u2026overview of ourselves too long lost among the bills of sale and letters of transit.\"35 The Combahee River Collective's \"A Black Feminist Statement\" was a manifesto that provided evidence of a political philosophy and a political vision that foregrounded violence against Black Women and other Women of Color without collusion with the state, policing, or crime panics\u2014or black heteropatriarchy, either. Their political vision also could enunciate \"what Blacks have done to and for themselves\"36 through movements, campaigns, advocacy, political education, and a long history of militant self-defense. The Collective wrote a manifesto that articulated a politics and a worldview of racialized gender consciousness that had always operated [End Page 268] from within the heart of liberation movements \"as central voices in feminist politics in both the women's movement and Black liberation organizations.\"37 To consider ourselves now in the light of Combahee means to read the militant Black feminist internationalist activists and philosophies of Combahee as the proper context of Black radicalism. That means that a collective such as this was confirming and declaring a multi-generational practice of a Black sexual and gender politics that aimed to render imperialist, classist, masculinist, nationalist, heteropatriachal, and deeply anti-Black racialized gender norms obsolete\u2014or at least to reveal how these norms existed in antagonism with Black Women's revolutionary self-love. Standing in their defiant reminder to the world that: Above all else, our politics initially sprang from the shared belief that Black women are inherently valuable, that our liberation is a necessity not as an adjunct to somebody else's may because of our need as human persons for autonomy. This may seem so obvious as to sound simplistic, but it is apparent that no other ostensibly progressive movement has ever considered our specific oppression as a priority or worked seriously for the ending of that oppression. Merely naming the pejorative stereotypes attributed to Black women (e.g. mammy, matriarch, Sapphire, whore, bulldagger), let alone cataloguing the cruel, often murderous, treatment we receive, indicates how little value has been placed upon our lives during four centuries of bondage in the Western hemisphere. We realize that the only people who care enough about us to work consistently for our liberation are us. Our politics evolve from a healthy love for ourselves, our sisters and our community which allows us to continue our struggle and work. This focusing upon our own oppression is embodied in the concept of identity politics. We believe that the most profound and potentially most radical politics come directly out of our own identity, as opposed to working to end somebody else's oppression. In the case of Black women this is a particularly repugnant, dangerous, threatening, and therefore revolutionary concept because it is obvious from looking at all the political movements that have preceded us that anyone is more worthy of liberation than ourselves. We reject pedestals, queenhood, and walking ten paces behind. To be recognized as human, levelly human, is enough.38 The Combahee River Collective's statement allows us to read our own history through the consciousness that they invoked. But it also compels us to consider not only who we are we after Combahee, but what we can learn by studying the conditions that animated them. What could have happened to Black Women on the East Coast in the 1970s to make them remember a militant response to normalized, un-remarked [End Page 269] upon, and yet fabulously ubiquitous and paradigmatic sexualized violence against Black Women? While it might seem systematic and reasonable to document the cases of murder of Black Women happening now as an ethical way to come to understand who murdered Black women in Boston in 1979, and then in Los Angeles from 1983 on, I need to turn our attention and our clocks back to what seems to be the origin of this current decimation\u2014the slavery era's breeding of Black Women for sexualized punishment to extend the life of individual non-black and white people and to extend the life of the whitened social order. Because that is what the medical plantation was about figuring out how to breed enslaved Black women and learning from enslaved Black women how to protect and care for the lives of every other kind of person. I come to this conversation through questions posed by the collective and their insistence that reproductive justice and reproductive health reflect not merely women's ability to choose whether, when, or if they would bear or rear children but instead the \"underlying realities of reproductive lives\" which constitute the basis for social reproduction, i.e. the cross-generational status of those who represent wombs carved up for Empire or the status of those hands doing, measuring, and witnessing the carving.39 Such questions of social reproduction and the social world remind me of alleged psychoses like Drapetomania and oppositional defiance disorder (and the pro-slavery social and psychological values) that insist that people in pain experience pain in profoundly individual ways instead of in wholly social ways. I am reminded also of the experience of listening to my 6-year-old son be pathologized as having \"super-human strength\"40 when adult men fantasize about and project onto him and his brother about how strong they are when playing afterschool program dodgeball\u2014somehow forgetting that they are revealing their own feelings of deficient masculinity in these tellings. Am I to be proud of their alleged super-human strength or frightened at what it portends for their small, small bodies, growing every day in a womb called a social world? The lauded medical research of the father of gynecology, J. Marion Sims (1813\u20131883) made the transnational jump; crossing the White Atlantic from South Carolina to France and back again.41 Memorialized in public statuary in multiple countries, the question of what we might call his \"relationship\" to the bodies of the Black Women he experimented upon, Lucy, Anarcha, and Betsey, is unresolved and unsettled. For those of us for whom \"medical apartheid\" and \"medical plantation\" are meaningful historiographical concepts, reading the legacies in contemporary culture of this normalized relationship between the murderous gendering of Black Women, on one hand, and the generative gendering of everyone else, on the other hand, is an important [End Page 270] way to understand who and what J. Marion Sims represents. In other words, what was normal in the mid 19th century was that new medical knowledge was sutured to painful, grotesque, deforming, and even deadly medical experimentation on enslaved women across the Americas that enabled the introduction of new medical technologies that advanced the quality of (white) life. Similarly what is normal in our own time is that new medical knowledge and improved quality of life continues to be sutured to medical experimentation on racialized women who have lost their basic civil rights through mass incarceration and territorial segregation even when they consent.'"

Black People Are Crazy: The Return of Drapetomania http://neguswhoread.com/black-people-are-crazy-drapetomania/' | contents: 'In the 1800's psychology and psychiatry were still new and inexact sciences filled with half-cocked, inane ideas about how the brain works. Many new world doctors based their psychiatric theories on the pseudoscience of race. One of the men on the forefront of the burgeoning movement was Dr. Samuel A Cartwright. In 1851 he proposed that there existed a mental illness rampant among slaves that made them belligerent and even caused them to wanted to escape from freedom. He called it Drapetomania. Drapetomania \u2013 (n.) a mental illness that causes Negroes to resist the institution of slavery and sometimes flee captivity Even though the scientific evidence for Drapetomania was eventually debunked, the idea of Black resistance as a mental illness still lingers. The Black Panthers of the 1960's were called \u201cparanoid maniacs.\u201d Fox News and other conservatives routinely paint the Black Lives Matter movement as insane belligerents infected with a hive mentality. After the uprisings in Ferguson and Baltimore, even President Obama had to sit White people down and explain to them that the hordes of young Black people upset by the treatment of the police were not \u201cmaking this stuff up.\u201d Yet there are many who still believe in the tenets of Drapetomania. The hardcore adherents simply believe that people of color don't take advantage of the opportunities America has to offer. They believe Black people don't work hard enough, or are genetically predisposed to an anti-democratic unruliness that causes them to \u201cplay the race card\u201d and whine about unfairness instead of focusing on family and education. Even the left-of-center liberals believe that race is not as much a problem as much as socioeconomic disparities and \u201clack of resources.\u201d They pretend to be accepting and understanding until they guffaw and are taken aback when some \u201cmilitant\u201d Black grabs the microphone from Bernie Sanders or interrupts a Bill Clinton stump speech. When Ashley Williams unfurled a banner with Hillary Clinton's own words, during a fundraising event, the crowd actually hissed at her. Hissed. What they fuck, white people? So this is strictly for my NegusWhoRead's white readers. I know many of you can't understand how your proclamation of \u201cAll Lives Matter,\u201d could upset anyone, or why your Black friends didn't roll up in a ball and weep at the injustice of the legal system when a jury found O.J. not guilty. It's because Black people are crazy. They suffer from the now-defunct diagnoses of Drapetomania. It has returned. As in all things\u2013from Avatar to 12 Years a Slave, it is up to our white saviors to notice the symptoms and rescue Black people from impending doom. Here are the classic symptoms so that you will know when your Black friend is suffering from early onset Drapetomania. Stage 1: The Wake Up \u2013 Thursday was \u201cwhipping day.\u201d There is a slave narrative that tells the story of a little girl who received her first whipping from the slave supervisor. For the entire next week she was on her best behavior, but she was still put in line to receive a flogging. She tried harder the next week, not even uttering a word, but she still received her weekly lashing. Finally she asked her older brother when the whippings would stop. He informed her that it was the slavemaster's job to whip them so that they would be motivated to work. He told her the beatings would end \u201cwhen they run out of whippings\u2026 Or cotton.\u201d After that, she became the most troublesome Negro on the plantation until she escaped two years later, but she said that day\u2013when she realized she was going to the weekly whipping post for the rest of her life\u2013was the day she stopped being a slave. One day you will arrive at work and notice that Lakeisha in accounts payable cut off all her beautiful, silky jet black hair. No, she didn't get a case of head lice, nor is she undergoing chemotherapy. This is how Drapetomania begins, but you shouldn't approach her yet. And FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT ASK TO TOUCH HER HAIR! Likewise, if your Black friend, Jamaal wears a daishiki to the company barbecue, take notice but don't be alarmed. They might be Drapetomania victims, but they are still in the \u201cwaking up\u201d phase. It could be temporary. Remember when Randy wore that Scottish Kilt to his grandfather's funeral? It's kinda like that. I know it makes you uncomfortable to see anyone eschew the European beauty aesthetic, but suppress your caucasian heebie jeebies and wait. It is your job to watch them closely and see if they wake all the way up. Your job is to make sure that they don't stay woke. By then it will be too late. They will be off the plantation by then. Stage 2. Speaking Up \u2013 Why must Black people frame everything around race? It's like they are consumed with it? Every time you get into a conversation about politics, current events or even personal stories, they always drag the discussion to race and Blackness. It must be a mental illness because it seems they are so focused on race that they can't concentrate on anything else. People who suffer from progressive Drapetomania equate race with every social, economic and political phenomenon, whereas most white people don't focus on race, unless it is concerning Obama. Or an Old Navy Ad. Or a Donald Trump rally. If you're white the rest of the world views you as a person, or a professional, or a friend, etc. but the world views your Black friend as your BLACK co-worker, or the BLACK professional, or the BLACK whatever. Don't listen to them, that's just the Drapetomania talking, even though you do think of Jamaal as your \u201cblack friend.\u201d Stage 3. Demand \u2013 Stage 3 Drapetomania reveals itself when Black people start wanting stuff and play the race card to get it. Affirmative action is a result of Drapetomaniacs demanding a level playing field. The Voting Rights Act is a result of uppity Black sufferers of the illness asking for constitutional rights. Appeasing those sick voices is part of the cure for Drapetomania. Instituting affirmative action hasn't erased the disparity in Black vs White employment rates. Voter ID laws and gerrymandering is a legal workaround to the Voting Rights Act. It's also why Lakeisha has been at the company for three years longer than you, has an advanced degree, but hasn't received a promotion. When she asks for a raise, they'll give it to her because the way to stop Drapetomania from advancing, according to Dr. Cartwright is: If the white man attempts to oppose the Deity's will, by trying to make the negro anything else than \u201cthe submissive knee-bender\u201d (which the Almighty declared he should be), by trying to raise him to a level with himself, or by putting himself on an equality with the negro; or if he abuses the power which God has given him over his fellow-man, by being cruel to him, or punishing him in anger, or by neglecting to protect him from the wanton abuses of his fellow-servants and all others, or by denying him the usual comforts and necessaries of life, the negro will run away; but if he keeps him in the position that we learn from the Scriptures he was intended to occupy, that is, the position of submission; and if his master or overseer be kind and gracious in his hearing towards him, without condescension, and at the same time ministers to his physical wants, and protects him from abuses, the negro is spell-bound, and cannot run away. Stage 4: The Escape \u2013 When acute Drapetomania hits, your Black friend will become very belligerent. You'll think they are crazy, and they are. Drapetomaniacs don't give a fuck. They are tired of being whipped. It might manifest itself as a single slave sneaking off into the night headed north towards freedom. Everyone has a breaking point, and a Stage 4 Drapetomania sufferer might do something crazy like jump on a man who is 100 lbs heavier and armed with a gun for following him through a Sanford, Florida neighborhood. There are even stories of a man who ran away from a Baltimore Police Officer simply because he had committed no crime and feared for his safety! I know it sounds illogical (because why would a police officer kill an innocent man?), but that's how mental illnesses like this work. Stage 5. The Slave Revolt \u2013 Every few generations, Drapetomania spreads through an entire community and the entire group decides to grab pitchforks and machetes aso they can \u201cget free.\u201d Cinque did it on a slave ship. Toussaint Louverture did it in Haiti. Denmark Vessey did it in South Carolina. They did it in Ferguson, Missouri. They did it in Baltimore. It will happen again. This is the stage everyone should fear because it makes no sense. Even though those Drapetomaniacs don't own those plantations or CVS's, people will still ask why they are setting fires, why they are in such a frenzy or even why they are burning down their own neighborhoods. The answer is simple. Either: a. For half a millennium Black people who didn't know each other, who lived in different places and in different generations have all coincidentally, but independently, grown tired and angry from centuries of being marginalized, abused and given the scraps from the table of a system that sucks their energy, culture and life while stiff-arming them away from any real American progress, or b. Black people are crazy.'"

Black Protest, White Backlash, and the History of Scientific Racism October 5, 2016 11 http://www.aaihs.org/black-protest-white-backlash-and-the-history-of-scientific-racism/' | contents: '\u201cMainstream culture\u2026defines threats to racial order as a form of madness that is, still, overwhelmingly located in the minds and bodies of black [people].\u201d \u2013Jonathan Metzl On September 28th, television host Bill Maher tweeted that \u201c#colinkapernick [sic] is a f**king idiot\u201d after the 49ers quarterback voiced his disappointment with both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on the basis that their campaigns are \u201ctrying to debate who is less racist.\u201d Maher's choice of invective has proven popular among those who disapprove of Colin Kaepernick's critique of white supremacy. Delegitimizing black protest by labeling its expressions as \u201cidiocy\u201d is not new. Since the very invention of the ideology of race, white people have struggled to accept black social protest on its own terms. Instead, white people have often marshaled the language of science to attribute black resistance to various forms of derangement, stupidity, and psychosis in an effort to delegitimize its critique of white supremacy. In fact, the endurance of white supremacy rests in its ability to construct, define, and police the boundaries of black pathology in the very moments in which it perceives deep challenges to its stability and legitimacy. When black protest threatens white supremacy, white \u201cscience\u201d steps in. The history of pathologizing black resistance to white oppression has its roots in the practice of U.S. slavery. Nineteenth century medical diagnoses, for instance, often reflected white slave-holding interests in the context of black protest and revolt. In 1851, Samuel A. Cartwright, a New Orleans physician and Confederate loyalist, published his \u201cReport on the Disease and the Physical Peculiarities of the Negro Race\u201d in which he argued that high rates of physical and mental illnesses afflicting black persons were products of the supposed biologically inferior mental capacity of the \u201cblack race.\u201d In this report, Cartwright introduced what he called \u201cDrapetomania,\u201d known as the \u201cDisease Causing Slaves to Run Away.\u201d He claimed that Drapetomania was curable except in \u201cslaves [who are] located on the borders of a free State, within a stone's throw of the abolitionists.\u201d Interestingly, Cartwright offered no explanation as to why these particular enslaved black communities could not be \u201ccured\u201d of their \u201cmental \u201cillness\u201d and thereby continued to flee northward toward freedom. While \u201ckindness\u201d\u2014keeping one's property well-fed, clothed, providing enough fuel to keep the enslaved warm at night, and so forth\u2014was the prescribed antidote to the \u201cdisease,\u201d Cartwright nonetheless warned that \u201cif any one or more of them, at any time, are inclined to raise their heads to a level with their master or overseer\u2026they should be punished until they fall into [a] submissive state\u2026.'\u201d Cartwright, in other words, viewed Drapetomania as a mental \u201cillness\u201d that could be beaten out of those who resisted enslavement. In the immediate aftermath of slavery, everyone from physicians to scholars and politicians sought to explain the supposed high-rates of diseases, most notably tuberculosis, among black communities. According to historian Tera Hunter, \u201cRace handicapped affluent blacks because they could not withstand the excessive \u2018mental strain' necessary to emulate the \u2018higher degree of civilization' and good health of \u2018the better class of their white neighbors.'\u201d The \u201cdiseases\u201d of black communities were therefore the black bodies physically breaking down because they could not handle the responsibilities of freedom. In the early twentieth century, black resistance was described as disease through the eugenics discourse of idiocy. Terms such as \u201cidiot\u201d and \u201cmoron\u201d emerged to classify those unfit for civic life and to justify deportation, institutionalization, or sterilization. Both terms were used to police the project of white (Anglo, Nordic) race preservation. The terms \u201cidiot\u201d and \u201cmoron\u201d entered into our nation's lexicon in 1910. At the annual meeting of the American Association for the Study of the Feeble-Minded, held in May of that year, racial eugenicist Henry Goddard proposed a taxonomic system\u2014\u201cidiot-imbecile-moron\u201d\u2014for classifying individuals with \u201cmental retardation\u201d based on an intelligence quotient (IQ). Goddard ascribed the term \u201cidiot\u201d to those with a mental age of less than three years. Moreover, he applied the term \u201cimbecile\u201d to those with a mental age of 3 to 7. A \u201cmoron,\u201d in Goddard's estimation, was best reserved for those with a mental age of 7 to 10. All three terms fell under the broad category of \u201cfeeble-mindedness.\u201d Goddard's typology also corresponded with precise IQ ranges: In 1917, Goddard was tapped to serve on the U.S. Army's Alpha and Beta Testing Team, a research body that conducted intelligence tests on over 1.7 million soldiers. A few years later, Goddard and his team published the results in their book, Psychology Examining in the United States Army. Whereas Goddard and his cohort found that 47 percent of whites from southern and eastern European countries could be classified as morons, they alleged that 89 percent of black soldiers fell into the same category. But the timing of the report's publication is curious especially given the prominent role black veterans played in resisting white lynch mob violence in the immediate aftermath of the war. In 1919, whites who were upset by black migration from the rural south to the urban north began a lynching campaign of near-historic proportions. According to the Library of Congress, at least 76 black Americans were lynched that year alone. In the war's immediate aftermath black veterans were often at the forefront of these violent confrontations. During the bloody \u201cRed Summer\u201d of 1919 in Chicago, Washington D.C., and Elaine, Arkansas and again three years later in Tulsa, Oklahoma demobilized black veterans used their combat experience and tactical and organizational knowledge to resist oppression in their communities. Alleging that 89 percent of black soldiers\u2014and therefore black veterans\u2014were morons, one can argue, served as a way of undermining their resistance to lynch mobs and the destruction of black communities. The delegitimization of black protest was again on display in 1968 at the height of the Black Power era when eminent psychiatrists Walter Bromberg and Frank Simon dreamed up a diagnosis\u2014\u201cprotest psychosis\u201d\u2014that described Black power as a form of \u201cdelusional anti-whiteness.\u201d Four years later, in \u201cSymbolism in Protest Psychosis,\u201d they forcefully described that malady as \u201ca psychotic illness with strong elements of racial hostility and black nationalism [that entails] the release of previously repressed anti-white feelings, which combine with African ideology and beliefs.\u201d In short, \u201c[the illness is oriented toward] reversing the white supremacy tradition or stating an objection to the accepted superiority of white values in terms of an African ideology.\u201d During the same period, and in keeping with Bromberg and Simon's thesis, the idea of schizophrenia shifted from a condition historically associated with \u201cwhite feminine docility\u201d to that of \u201cangry black masculinity.\u201d In his compelling text, The Protest Psychosis: How Schizophrenia Became a Black Disease, Dr. Johnathan Metzl demonstrated how schizophrenia's new clinical parameters were signaled in the second edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published in 1968. Schizophrenia, he argued, was reorganized as a \u201cdisorder of masculinized belligerence\u201d through the language of hostility and aggression. According to Metzl, the diagnosis \u201cmirrored the social context of its origins in ways that enabled users to knowingly or unknowingly pathologize protest as mental illness [or cognitive deficiency].\u201d Contemporary attempts to delegitimize black protest as \u201cidiocy\u201d reflects the scientific discourse of pathology that has been evident in white critiques of black resistance for decades. Arguing that black protest is grounded in derangement, stupidity, and psychosis is precisely what allows white people to sidestep the actual content of black activists' demands. Perhaps we can begin to understand and to respect black resistance by affirming that Colin Kaepernick is not an idiot; that black veterans fighting lynch mobs were not morons; that enslaved men and women who ran away were not diseased; and that the unwavering demand to be regarded as \u201cfully human\u201d in the eyes of the state does not signal a psychotic break. To the contrary, black protest, in all its forms, fundamentally challenges white supremacy and affirms blackness as fundamental to the fabric of our democratic society in the making.'"

Here there is a refusal to play the game of the anticipatory regime \u2212 no individualised target-setting, strategic planning or algorithmic risk assessments \u2212 and a commitment to \u2018delink' from such regimes of epistemic and social control in order to enlarge the space of emergence for liberatory alternatives. While each of these un/learning projects is singular to its own social and historical context, educational researchers who traverse between them suggest that all are distinguished by how they engage with learning and the future in ways that are \u2018not tamed, reduced, abstracted or detached' but rather through methods that start \u2018from our whole being and within our network of relationships with others, humans, non-human beings and things', and how they articulate an \u2018existential, embodied and non-future-oriented understanding and experience of hope' (Mandell, 2014). This mode of critical anticipation is positioned geopolitically in the margins and exteriorities of a world system that is otherwise represented as the only possible horizon of global knowledge politics. Here, abstract concepts of time and \u2018universal' criteria of value co-exist with many others, including those which are invisible and unrealized (Grosfoguel, 2012). This perspective discloses the historical and geopolitical specificity \u2212 and interrupts the normalisation \u2212 of the repressive anticipatory regimes which are active in British education today. As Raymundo S\u00e1nchez Barraza, General Co-ordinator of the Fray Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas Comprehensive Indigenous Training Center (CIDECI Las Casas) in Mexico, explained: \u2018we positioned ourselves from the beginning on the margins of prophetic critique, vis-\u00e0-vis history, vis-\u00e0-vis the world, vis-\u00e0-vis the demands of the minorities, the despised, conquered peoples\u2026'. It is a \u2018shoeless university just from below' (2005). The starting point for this critical anticipation emerges from the experience of violence. It starts from the impossibility of rational \u2018anticipation', as experienced by those who have historically been denied possibilities for self-determination through the interweaving of epistemic technologies with colonial oppression (Grosfoguel, 2013; Mignolo, 2000). The ambition of learners here is not to optimize their capacities to fulfil a predetermined future, particularly that of colonizing \u2018progress' which has annihilated indigenous people, lands, languages, knowledges and ways of life. Rather, it demands a kind of radical critique that the Argentine decolonial semiotician Walter Mignolo calls \u2018epistemic disobedience'. This is not a skill that can be learned through demonstrating \u2018progress' in learning against nationally standardized learning targets and outcomes; it requires the unlearning of what is presently required for inclusion and success in this system. Epistemic disobedience is not a method for more of the recognition or competitive advantage that promises fleeting future securities in a marketized anticipatory regime, but a \u2018definitive rejection of \u201cbeing told\u201d from the epistemic privileges of the zero point what \u201cwe\u201d are, what our ranking is in relation to the ideal of humanitas and what we have to do to be recognized as such' (Mignolo, 2009). The epistemologies and technologies of the neoliberal anticipatory regime described earlier in this paper are excellent examples of the violence of a \u2018naturalized grammar of colonial modernity' which promotes certainty and linear causality, universal reason, teleology and linear time, the coherence of the Cartesian subject, the historical progression of a single humanity which can be reduced to standardized measures of evaluation, and the salvation of ontological, economic and political security within a framework of domination (Andreotti, 2015). The pressing question for educators working against the colonization of the future by dominating social systems, however, is not how to minimize future risks to the advancement of these logics, but \u2018whether the world is going to survive' despite them and how to resist and survive the destruction of worlds in the present. From this point of departure, Barraza (2005) remarked, \u2018we're going by another path, not by this world's path with its model of profits, marketing, exploitation, greed, control, contempt for the different'. It is a path of learning and organizing autonomy and democracy, and creating conditions for new possibilities even \u2212 or especially \u2212 when these remain unknown and as yet unhoped for. Co-founder of the associated University of the Earth, Gustavo Esteva, elaborates this anti-instrumental relationship between learning and the future through the words of the dissident novelist and former Czech president Vaclav Havel, not as \u2018joy when things are going well or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obviously headed for early success, but rather an ability to work for something to succeed' and to value this process \u2018regardless of how it turns out', because it is this process, less so than the outcome, which \u2018gives us strength to live and to continually try new things, even in conditions that seem as hopeless as ours do, here and now' (Havel, cited by Esteva, in Mandell, 2014). This form of relating to the future allows for us to not predict or know the world in advance, but rather to be \u2018shocked' by it in the present, so that educational opportunity means making sense and embracing radically new perspectives, ideas and challenges without \u201cfalling back into habits\u201d of interpretation or domesticating them with scientifically rationalities (Mandell, 2014).'"

One of its central considerations must be black politics and its anticolonial/antiracial conditions of possibility. This is because the solidarity logics of blackness implicated in the signifier \u201cblack politics\u201d continue to be insurgent in and repressed by Western capitalist, liberal democratic polities. Our understanding of the social, cultural, and existential oppositional activities among dispersed populations of African descent has been largely derived from black antislavery/ anticolonial/antiracial mobilizations spanning the sixteenth to twenty-first centuries. Nevertheless, it remains the case that black politics appears to be one of the least elucidated and most contested concepts in contemporary political discourse. This is partly because whatever has been represented and configured as black politics has also been routinely marginalized, pathologized, repudiated, or attacked in Western political theory and Western polities. Delineating and contributing to a distinctive field of black political thought has always required that we recuperate conceptually the Western-attributed outlaw status of black politics. Here the task also becomes thinking through the constitutively fugitive formations of black politics, tracking them as they cut into, interrupt, and expose the modern capitalist, liberal democratic tradition of representing the Western polity outside of its colonial-racial gestations. Thinking about black politics in this way also requires being attentive to revealing and analyzing the repressions, repudiations, and violations of black politics in the Western colonial-racial order of things and populations. This approach, however, cannot be developed without recognizing that political mobilizations of \u201cblackness\u201d have always had different and dispersed meanings across time and space (e.g., in North America, Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Europe). It entails understanding different political forms of blackness as territorialization, where dissenting meanings and oppositional practices are inscribed in solidarities tied to particular events, debates, or situations within historical attachments to particular social boundaries (e.g., nations, cities, and histories).1 At the same time, we need to think about different political forms of blackness as deterritorialization. 2 This involves the creative disembedding of particular meanings of black solidarity from local events and settings, where these meanings become transferable to other places, linking previously disparate black communities in affinity and dialogical networks of discourses and activities. Since 2014 this political dynamic of territorialization and deterritorialization has increasingly become a mainstay in the proliferation of mobilizations against the violence of racial policing across the black diaspora under the political slogan \u201cBlack lives matter.\u201d Against Western Normative Thought How does our approach to black political thought think about the critique registered by various manifestations of black politics? In a revelatory sense, black politics is symptomatic of Western hegemony as white supremacy. Its incidence reveals formations of race and coloniality within Western polities that are regularly disavowed by Western normative thought. This means that black politics is structurally possible only in relation to Western normative regimes whose liberal-democratic-capitalist institutions are embedded in racial/colonial histories and formations belied by Western normative institutions. This has important consequences for how we understand the provenance of black political thought in relation to the Western polity. It means recognizing that, historically, unlike the Renaissance, the Reformation, or the Enlightenment in Western normative thought, antislavery, anticolonialism, and antiracism have yet to be considered significant to theorizing modern Western political categories, identities, and formations. At the same time, we have yet to fully explore how radical interventions and ideas introduced by black politics (e.g., white supremacy, racial capitalism, black bodily integrity, and black fugitivity) have confronted and exposed the conceptual insufficiency of Western normative thought. Schematically, Western normative thought works through categories that presuppose a universal hegemony of Western values (e.g., liberalism's humanist and edifying version of modernity), while treating race as an exception to the episteme of its normative rule. In oppositional distinction, the \u201cblack radical tradition\u201d (Robinson 1983) acts as a site of critical thought. It provincializes and problematizes the idea of Western normativity, reinhabiting it with a critical marking and interrogation of modernity's colonial foundations, thereby conceptualizing race as constitutive of the episteme of Western normative rule. Western critical thought is subversive of the colonial-racial foundations of Western hegemony and white supremacy. The intellectual challenge for the Western critical enterprise of black political thought is analogous to what has been suggested by Edouard Glissant for Caribbean thought in comprehending the dislocating impact of Atlantic slavery on any conventional sense of historical continuity and contemporary presence in social, cultural, and political formations. It becomes imperative to question any intellectual genre of divisions that might fracture the different possibilities of analytical and diasporic coherence in the contextual study of black politics and to develop an openness to \u201call the perspectives of the human sciences,\u201d challenging these divisions and their \u201cinherited categories\u201d where they constitute a potential \u201cobstacle to a daring new methodology\u201d (Glissant 1989: 65). The aim is to generate alternative, critical interventions that inaugurate \u201ca revaluation of the conventions of analytical thought\u201d (65). That revaluation is important because black political thought shares much of the same analytical vocabulary as Western normative thought, as well as breaking with its normativity. Consequently, it becomes necessary to avoid any disabling collusions with political analyses inherited from conventions that have routinely dismissed critiques of their racial and colonial formations. This is what epitomizes the Western critical thinking of Cedric Robinson, Sylvia Wynter, Angela Davis, Stuart Hall, Hortense Spillers, Paul Gilroy, Saidiya Hartman, and Achille Mbembe. Each of these thinkers, in different ways, can be drawn on to explain how the national, classed, gendered, diasporic, black political subject, in its territorialized and deterritorialized incarnations, navigates and contests the violations and oppressions of Western normative ideals and institutions conventionally conceptualized as exterior to each other (e.g., humanism and racism). The Western polity is confronted by black political thought's exposure of it obscuring and denying its imbrication in the liberal and the colonial, democracy and race, universalism and Eurocentrism. Specifying and interrogating the resilient entanglements of race, its colonial disciplinary dynamics and hegemonic discourses of disavowal in Western polities continues to mark resistances to the shared and inherited black diasporic problem of racial subordination and racial violence, racially constrained democratic incorporation, and racially hypervisual exoticization in sports and entertainment (Iton 2008; Carrington 2010). All of this confronts black political thought today as much as it did during the early twentieth century. Reconstructed Blackness The principal metaphor of W. E. B. DuBois's Black Reconstruction in America ([1935] 1998) remains instructive for our version of black political thought. DuBois's reexamination of the politics of the Reconstruction period of American history (1860\u201380) is a radical critique of the Western institution of democracy in its racial form and idiom. To demonstrate this, DuBois foregrounds the subordinated black activist experience as the political lens through which to view the events of Reconstruction and its subsequent white historiography. He describes various circumstances in which the political and educational activities undertaken by the black population had been deemed a contaminant of the white institutional legitimation of US democracy, whether the black persons involved were enslaved or free. DuBois also noted that the actual participation of black people in the democratic institutions of Reconstruction, whether through voting, elections, assembly deliberations, or lawmaking, desired to go beyond the kind of freedom made racially available as an unprotected and unguaranteed citizenship by the federal government because it was antagonistic to the racial kind of democracy defined as representative of a modern nation-state. DuBois was aware that black politics ran counter to the white institution of US democracy. That countering emerged because, while slavery had been a constitutive part of democracy in the United States, its abolition now raised the black political question, how does one emancipate democracy from the white jurisdiction of race? It was in relation to that kind of question that DuBois ([1935] 1998: 721) provides us with his rationale for black political thought, where he writes: \u201cThe chief witness in Reconstruction, the emancipated slave himself, has been almost barred from court. His written Reconstruction record has been largely destroyed and nearly always neglected. . . . In other words, every effort has been made to treat the Negro's part in Reconstruction with silence and contempt.\u201d Of course, the masculine idiom in which DuBois specified the Negro as the black political subject requires constant interrogation, interruption, and displacement. This should be borne in mind when drawing on DuBois's understanding of two theoretical problems posed for black political thought. First, there was the \u201cracial revolution\u201d of an expanded democracy in the United States following the Civil War, the abolition of slavery, and the short-lived egalitarian possibilities of Reconstruction. This had created and legitimated a white democracy in its practices, if not in its discourses. Second, there was the reemergent white democracy predicated on a disavowal of black politics in its administrative forms and the administrative removal of black populations from deepening their social participation in democracy. This had resulted in the discrediting of black politics. For DuBois ([1935] 1998: 715), the disavowal of black politics began with the white political and intellectual erasure of the significance of black people's struggles to resist, escape, and abolish slavery, in an \u201cattempt to enter democracy.\u201d For DuBois, the displacement of black politics from US political history and discourse was motivated by the desire to avoid any racial disruption to institutional arrangements that privileged the normativity of white hegemony. The politics of the ex-slaves presaged an insistence that democracy be transformed by the eradication of white hegemony and its expansion through black self-representation and participation. It suggested that race was constitutively structural in Western liberal democracy and that black politics existed in a relation of racial antagonism with the Western polity. Through this approach to conceptualizing black politics DuBois was also struggling to explain the Western performative political script of racially governing black populations through the imbricated rule of liberalism-colonialism and democracy whiteness, while formally representing these imbricated aspects of race through governance as if they were constitutionally separate and incommensurable. We can perhaps read the metaphor black reconstruction as evoking black politics in a symptomatic reading of the racial political form of the polity and society it confronted, which could not be deduced from the lexicon of US democracy and Western normative thought. Black politics was symptomatic of a white constitutive logic that ensured that Western democracy was underlined by its repression of a black politics that sought to transform or counteract it. In short, for DuBois black politics exposed the normalized white administration of a democratic regime, which became visible when confronted by the black politics that challenged it. As we will see, this metaphor of black reconstruction continues to resonate both contemporaneously and globally. Contemporary Global Black Protest The longue dur\u00e9e of black politics has been grounded in its reactions to the imbrication of the liberal-democratic and the colonial-racial in Western political formations. However, despite our apparent transition to the postcolonial and post\u2013civil rights eras, Western states continue to reproduce and disavow the grounds for black politics. The question of the racial emancipation of democracy, or indeed its decolonization, therefore, recurrently poses irrepressible predicaments for black political thought. A half century after most states in Africa achieved independence and the civil rights movement in the United States succeeded in ending Jim Crow racial segregation, and a quarter century after black South Africans overthrew apartheid, renewed black protest movements around the globe are beginning to question the forms and aims of black politics and the limits of liberal democracy. Globally, black protest movements originating from local concerns are responding in different ways to the inability of liberal democracy to deliver robust racial justice and inviolable equal rights, drawing attention to the unfinished project of decolonization and the unrelenting dehumanization of black lives resulting from the precarity induced by global white supremacy (however much the latter may have morphed). A global wave of black protest is legible from uprisings against police violence in the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, France, Canada, and Israel and from student protests in South Africa.3 A common thread in Western normative critiques of the disruptive tactics deployed by these black protesters is the notion that black rage is counterproductive and that it needs to be disciplined and contained in order to gain the legitimation of representative democracy. However, by focusing on the political experiences of those whom Anthony Bogues (2012) calls its \u201cliving corpses,\u201d we see that democracy has always been unrepresentative and incomplete because its racial denial of political rights to some\u2014rather than being a contradiction of its core principles\u2014has instead underwritten the white privileged ability of others to claim such rights. The key insight of the black politics developing in these protests centers on marking Western democracy's white limits. At the same time, it also points to one of the fundamental paradoxes of black politics, namely, the invariable futility of directing activism toward a racially governing regime historically founded on the constitutive exclusion and violation of blackness. Meditating on the meaning of black politics in the postcolonial independence, post\u2013civil rights, postapartheid era, Richard Iton (2008: 30\u201331) suggests that a \u201csteady rhetorical retreat . . . has characterized black politics since the Cold War,\u201d marked by \u201cthe celebration of pragmatism, instrumentalism, and compromise . . . and the rhetorical shunning and shaming of protest activities.\u201d Iton highlights the poverty of political imagination exhibited by forms of black politics circumscribed by modern/colonial formations whose aim was inclusion within existing state structures and dominant subject formations. For us, this means that the pressing question in black politics is no longer civil separation versus civil integration, if indeed it ever was, but rather the foreclosure of more radical and transformative visions by acceptance of an improved version of the liberal democratic status quo as the limited horizon of political philosophy and political possibility. Faced with such a resilient conjuncture, Iton suggests that we need to move beyond \u201cthe predominance of the state as the sole frame for . . . progressive and transformative discourse and mobilization\u201d (17). In his view, this means moving away from exclusive reliance on the formal arena of Western politics and reinvigorating the subversive and anarchic practices of black popular culture to cultivate more emancipatory and transformative political imaginaries. While our aim here is not to suggest that black politics should retreat entirely from the formally political, following Iton we do want to suggest that we need to think against and in excess of the centrality of the state as the horizon of political intelligibility. One problem with state-and-rights-centric forms of black political activism is that their discourse becomes fixated on the state's responsibility to resolve its own failures to create and institutionalize racial justice. They promote a bizarre turn to the Western state as the ultimate safeguard of rights it has historically and racially denied. Indeed, to view it as the protector of rights given its long history as the source of violence against black citizens is almost perverse. Moreover, replacing bodies phenotypically marked as white with those phenotypically marked as black in elected office does not magically transform the racial character of the state (Goldberg 2001). These strategic limitations of formal modes of black politics have been starkly exposed by protest movements in South Africa and the United States. For example, in 2016 the protests of black schoolgirls in South Africa against the failure to decolonize South African education at all levels was captured by the hashtag #StopRacismAtPretoriaGirlsHigh, which quickly went viral. The photographs and videos of young black girls proudly wearing Afros and facing off against adult white school administrators who had deemed natural hairstyles \u201cuntidy\u201d or \u201cbarbaric\u201d sparked global support far beyond South Africa and eventually led Ministry of Education officials to intervene and suspend the discriminatory hairstyle regulations. Yet the belated state action spurred by the global outcry following the black schoolgirls' protest was that of a South African state that has been dominated by a majority-black political party, the African National Congress (ANC), since the end of apartheid. The handover of political power to a predominantly black party did not radically transform the material conditions of poor, black South Africans, nor did it fundamentally alter the Eurocentric premises of educational institutions. T. O. Molefe (2016: 32) has argued that the ideas articulated by the #FeesMustFall university student protesters represented \u201ca departure from the nonracial conciliatory \u2018Rainbow Nation' project of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, [Nelson] Mandela, and the ANC and a new way of grappling with the outcomes of a history of patriarchy, slavery, imperialism, colonialism, white supremacy, and capitalism.\u201d South Africa's black student protests emphasized \u201canti-orthodoxy, solidarity, and revolution\u201d (32), thereby questioning the meaning of state power and envisioning more revolutionary forms of black politics. Meanwhile, in the United States it could be argued that one of the reasons the Black Lives Matter protests against gratuitous and disproportionate police violence (which is hardly a new phenomenon in nonwhite communities) gained such national visibility was that they occurred during the administration of a black president. That a black man could attain the highest elected political office in the country and yet black men, women, and children continued to be killed with impunity in the streets by the police raised deeply unsettling questions about the strategy of pursuing black restitution through electoral politics, mirroring what had been the dominant form of black politics in the United States in the post\u2013civil rights era. The predictable contradictions of attempts to achieve radical change through formal politics aimed primarily at the state have thus been thrown into stark relief by contemporary black protest movements. We can think of black political thought, informed by these activisms, as attempting to create the conceptual space to articulate more emancipatory and decolonializing forms of black activism in'"

Du Bois Review; Cambridge Vol. 1, Iss. 1, (Mar 2004): 27-45.' | contents: 'Sadly, while the moral prescriptions of this normative structure pervade nearly every aspect of our lives and have been used consistently to marginalize African Americans further, little attention has been paid, at least in the social sciences, to how the normalizing influences of the dominant society have been challenged, or at least countered, often by those most visible as its targets. Reflecting Michel Foucault's idea of simultaneous repressive and generative power, individuals with little power in society engage in counter normative behaviors, having babies before they are married, structuring their relationships differently from the traditional nuclear family, or rejecting heterosexuality completely. These so-called deviants have chosen and acted differently, situating their lives in direct contrast to dominant normalized understandings of family, desire, and sex. It is these instances of deviant practice, resulting from the limited agency of those most marginal in Black communities that are the heart of this work. Scholars, especially those interested in the evolving nature of Black politics, must take seriously the possibility that in the space created by deviant discourse and practice, especially in Black communities, a new radical politics of deviance could emerge. It might take the shape of a radical politics of the personal, embedded in more recognized Black counter publics, where the most marginal individuals in Black communities, with an eye on the state and other regulatory systems, act with the limited agency available to them to secure small levels of autonomy in their lives. Ironically, through these attempts to find autonomy, these individuals, with relatively little access to dominant power, not only counter or challenge the presiding normative order with regard to family, sex, and desire, but also create new or counter normative frameworks by which to judge behavior. And while these choices are not necessarily made with explicitly political motives in mind, they do demonstrate that people will challenge established norms and rules and face negative consequences in pursuit of goals important to them, often basic human goals such as pleasure, desire, recognition, and respect. These visible choices and acts of defiance challenge researchers to identify how we might leverage the process people use to choose deviance to choose political resistance as well. It just might be that after devoting so much of our energy to the unfulfilled promise of access through respectability, a politics of deviance, with a focus on the transformative potential found in deviant practice, might be a more viable strategy for radically improving the lives and possibilities of those most vulnerable in Black communities. Finally, it is important to remember, as theorists of stigma and deviance have written, that understandings of what is respectable and stigmatized or normal and deviant are constructed and relational. Erving Goffman (1963) in his book Stigma writes, \"Society establishes the means of categorizing persons and the complement of attributes felt to be ordinary and natural for members of each of these categories. ... We lean on these anticipations that we have, transforming them into normative expectations, into righteously presented demands\" (p. 2). Howard Becker (1973) in his study of the sociology of deviance continues along this line of reasoning and suggests that scholars be attuned to the distinction between rule-breaking behavior and the labeling of such behavior as deviant. He writes, \"... deviance is not a quality of the act the person commits, but rather a consequence of the application by others of rules and sanctions to an 'offender.' The deviant is one to whom that label has successfully been applied; deviant behavior is behavior that people so label\" (p. 9). In the rest of this article I will explore the feasibility of a politics of deviance in Black communities. I begin this investigation with a brief review of the major frameworks for studying Black politics. I then recount the ways deviance has been examined in some of the canonical texts in African American Studies. Finally, I detail how we might build an analytic model detailing the relationship between deviance, defiance, and resistance. TWENTIETH-CENTURY OBSESSIONS: A BLACK POLITICS OF RESPECTABILITY, ELITES, AND PUBLIC OPINION A review of much of the recent scholarship exploring the politics of African Americans reveals at least three dominant analytic frameworks of study: mobilization, respectability, and public opinion. While each of these approaches to investigating Black politics allows for the inclusion of those most vulnerable and seemingly \"deviant\" in Black communities, absent in each approach is a serious examination of the potential for politics in the everyday decisions and actions of these individuals and groups. For example, possibly the most widely read form of analysis of Black politics has been scholarship documenting and analyzing the organized efforts, formal and informal movements, and less structured uprisings originating in Black communities, meant to alter hierarchies of power and resources based at least partially in racial distinctions (Horne 1995; Kelley 2002; Marable 1991; Morris 1984). Work ranging from an analysis of Black revolts under slavery to the nationalist efforts of leaders like Marcus Garvey to the election of Black politicians to the mass mobilization defining the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements are all part of this tradition. However, more often than not, such scholarly analyses have sought to highlight those structured, coordinated, and seemingly purposeful acts assumed to comprise meaningful political struggle. Furthermore, these studies have at times been so consumed with the actions of leaders, usually male leaders, and well-established political organizations that they have ignored the everyday contests over space, dress, and autonomy that may pervade the lives of average Black people. Most of this literature, even when presumably exploring the work of \"everyday\" people, looks to those clearly defined political spaces like churches, civil rights organizations, and unions to find politics and political work, negating social spaces where most politics is lived (Harris-Lacewell 2004; Kelley 1994; Scott 1990). Of course, a politics of mobilization has not been the only lens through which African American politics has been explored and described. A second dominant framework used to understand Black politics has been that of respectability. In this approach respectability is used to categorize a process of policing, sanitizing, and hiding the nonconformist and some would argue deviant behavior of certain members of African Americans communities (Carby 1987, Gaines 1996, Higginbotham 1993). In this literature respectability is understood as a strategy deployed primarily by the Black middle class but also by other individuals across the Black class strata to demonstrate their adherence to and upholding of the dominant norms of society. It is hoped and expected that such conformity will confer full citizenship status, bringing with it greater access, opportunities, and mobility. And while some recent scholarship has cast a critical eye on the exclusionary processes associated with a political strategy of respectability, it is important that we not trivialize or demean this vehicle to political advancement since for many African Americans it was not only a mechanism to leverage dominant power but also a means to demonstrate the basic humanity and equality of Black Americans (Carby 1987, Gaines 1996, Higginbotham 1993, McBride 1998). It is, however, important to underscore, as critics of respectability remind us, the relative positioning necessary to prove that one is respectable and acceptable compared to other less fortunate \"souls\" who compromise the excluded. Historian Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham (1993), in her examination of Black women's involvement and leadership in the Baptist church in the early twentieth century, describes the use of a politics of respectability to counter the dominant racist constructions of Blackness and gender. She writes, \"While adherence to respectability enabled Black women to counter racist images and structures, their discursive contestation was not directed solely at White Americans; the black Baptist women condemned what they perceived to be negative practices and attitudes among their own people. Their assimilationist leanings led to their insistence upon Blacks' conformity to the dominant society's norms of manners and morals. Thus the discourse of respectability disclosed class and status differentiation\" (p. 187). Thus, another approach to studying the politics of African Americans, an approach first deployed by scholars in the humanities, has been an interrogation of the extra-institutional, some might say, social and cultural actions of Black Americans. Through the framework of respectability the researcher is primarily concerned with the actions of those who would regulate, most often middle-class Black Americans and working-class Blacks with middle-class aspirations. Again, lost in this analysis are the agency and actions of those under surveillance, those being policed, those engaged in disrespectable behavior. Missing from this understanding of Black politics is what Robin Kelley calls \"a politics from below\" (1994, p. 5). The third and final approach to the study of Black politics I will mention briefly is the overwhelming focus on the public opinion of Black Americans found in the social sciences today, especially in the field of political science. Increasingly, as researchers in the social sciences became committed to the use of large N datasets to map out the political attitudes and behaviors of ordinary people, so too did scholars in the field of Black politics demonstrate increasing expertise in the use of statistical analysis in conjunction with newly developed datasets such as the National Black Election Study and the National Black Politics Study to explore the declared politics of Black respondents. The work of scholars such as Michael Dawson (2003, 1994), Larry Bobo (2000), Katherine Tate (1998), and many others has provided new insights into the ideological and behavioral dimensions of African American politics in the late twentieth century. Unfortunately, while this literature often includes close analysis of differences in political attitudes and behavior based on class and in some cases sex and gender, the in-depth exploration of how such differences might be molded into a new politics for the twenty-first century has largely been ignored. This scholarship tends to excel in identifying and explaining differences found among African Americans and between African Americans and other members of racial and ethnic groups, most often White Americans. Left for a later day has been any sustained discussion of how the differences identified manifest themselves in the everyday lives and politics of Black people. Similarly, scholars of this orientation seem to shy away from more theoretical and normative discussions of what should be done to change the patterns of inequality, alienation, and anger evident in their data. Thus, while all three of these approaches to analyzing politics and political work in Black communities have generated important insights, illuminating the multiple forms of resistance and ideas about politics found among Black Americans, there exists an inherent bias in each framework toward the recognition and study of a politics that is declared and traditionally organized. I am not suggesting that the political activity of poor, working-class, and marginal Black people has not made its way into our published accounts of Black politics. Instead, I contend that the politics of those most marginal in Black communities are usually discussed when they conform to traditional understandings of what constitutes legitimate politics, ranging from engagement with formal political institutions to the traditional, extra-systemic politics of riots, boycotts, and protests, to the adherence to dominant norms and expectations regarding behavior. Again, missing is an examination of the possibility of oppositional politics rooted outside of traditional or formal political institutions and, instead, in the daily lived experiences of those most marginal in Black communities. Given these absences, those of us concerned with the lives and politics of Black people might do well to recalibrate our lens of examination toward those deemed \"deviant\" in Black communities, for here lies not only understudied populations but more importantly groups engaging in behaviors that I believe hold the potential for new understandings of how Black politics might once again become radically transformative for Black communities and the country at large. By transformative I am not arguing merely for better policies or a slight shift in the distribution of wealth and power, important as these advances are. Instead, I am suggesting that through a focus on \"deviant\" practice we are witness to the power of those at the bottom, whose everyday life decisions challenge, or at least counter, the basic normative assumptions of a society intent on protecting structural and social inequalities under the guise of some normal and natural order to life. However, not only do these individuals daily act in opposition to dominant norms, but they also contradict members of Black communities who are committed to mirroring perceived respectable behaviors and hierarchal structures. I am urging scholars to take a critical and respectful look at such behavior, instead of the instinctive reaction of rushing to pathologize such acts. With careful investigation we might begin to understand why the same people who daily \"reject\" formal and informal incentives for conformity, choosing instead alternative and oppositional live-styles, are most often not engaged in the kind of mass mobilization that organizers and academics contend would significantly improve their lived condition. It is time for a new generation of scholars to put forth a new analytic framework for the study of Black politics, that of deviance. This, of course, means hearing from and listening to those who many would silence and make invisible in Black communities, individuals like single Black mothers, including those on welfare and/or teen-agers; gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer members of Black communities; Black men on the \"down-low\" having at times risky sex with both men and women; and young Black men and women who are currently or have been incarcerated and who seem to engage uncritically in unlawful behavior with knowledge of the growing consequences of such behavior. Only by listening to their voices, trying to understand their motivations, and accurately centering their stories with all of its complexities in our work can we begin to understand and map the connection between deviant practice, defiant behavior, and political resistance.'"

Scott' | contents: 'Dehumanizing and pathologizing Black women through hegemonic images in order to control us carries over into the present day (see, c.g., Davis, 2006; Richie, 2012; Roberts, 2003). The \"angry black woman\" is one of the most prevalent contemporary stereotypes about Black women that functions to stifle our voices and impede dissent by portraying us as aggressive, irrational, ill-tempered, and hostile, regardless of the circumstances or provocation (Morgan 8: Bennett, 2006). This stereotype is so common that even Black women in extremely prestigious positions such as Michelle Obama have been undermined by accusations of embodying this stereotype (Harris-Perry, 2011; Johnson, 2012; Madison, 2009). According to Madison (2009), stereotyping Michelle Obama as an \"angry black woman\" during the 2008 presidential campaign \"was both easier and more compatible with normalized notions of gender and blackness than to engage the more complicated genealogy of black rage in the USA\" (p. 323). In a similar vein, in tracing the evolution of her resistance work, author/ blogger Mia McKenzie (a.k.a. Black Girl Dangerous) calls attention to the silencing of Black women in the following statement: I thought about all the white women who had labeled me angry or aggressive just because I refused to be silent or invisible...I decided that instead of being silent. . .I would he louder. That instead of becoming invisible, I would become manifest. That instead of being defeated, I would triumph...over everyone who ever looked at a black woman and saw someone who could be silenced, someone whose story didn't matter, whose voice didn't count...l decided that, instead of dying, I would live. And that I would be dangerous. Really dangerous. The kind of dangerous that would make a difference in the world. (2014, pp. 3-4) Black women's anger and even rage can produce moments of profound clarity. Furthermore, in calling out the utter hypocrisy of white supremacist (il)logic, both Harris' and McKenzie's refusal to self-censor and kow tow to white supremacist social control is tactically transformative and liberatory. bell hooks (1989) states that for Black women: ...true speaking is not solely an expression of creative power; it is an act of resistance, a political gesture that challenges politics of domination that would render us nameless and voiceless. As such, it is a courageous act-as such, it represents a threat. To those who wield oppressive power, that which is threatening must necessarily be wiped out, annihilated, silenced. (p. 8) Because Black women are one of the most vulnerable populations in the academy (Nzinga-Johnson, 2013), true speaking is an act that Few of us are in a position to and / or are brave enough to engage in nowadays. Thus when Black women academics do choose to Blackspmle angry (neck- rolling) truth to power, to push back against the politics of respectability and against white middle-class civility and fragility, it is more than an act of political will, it is an act of apostasy! That is what those that seek to control Black women fear the m0st-when we are angry, woke, and unafraid. This is the way it has been historically and it is thus the rebellious voices of Black foremothers that motivate my forward movement. Writer Lorene Cary captures my sentiments about the influence of Black women's voices on her own writing: \"They burst into my silence, and in my head, they shouted and chattered and whispered and sang together. I am writing...to become part of that unruly conversation, and to bring my experience back to the community of minds that made it possible\" (Johnson 8: Loch, 1995, p. 17). The remainder of this chapter is my attempt to join \"that unruly conversation\" as I explore my anger as an ongoing personal, intel- lectual, political, and pedagogical project as a Black woman professor tra- versing hostile terrain while seeking to destabilize a white supremacist patriarchal academy and society. The \"angry Black woman\" stereotype dehumanizes Black women by reducing all of our individuality and complexity to a single emotion: anger. It is an erasure of the multiplicity of our identities, our histories, our cul- tures, our experiences, and it ultimately \"shrinks us to shells of ourselves\" (Mock, 2014, p. 249). Furthermore, this stereotype pathologizes Black women whose behaviors do not conform to white middleclass standards and this is exacerbated by racist, ethnocentric, and xenophobic (mis)inter- pretations of Black women's cultural expressions (Ashely, 2014; Baraka, 1997; Lanehart, 2002). This emotional reductionism coupled with the widespread expectation that Black women be strong/superwomen-or like Nanny in Their Eyes Were Watching God says, \"de mule uh de world\" (Hurston, 1990)-masks and therefore neglects our very real human pain and vulnerabilities (Beaubeouf-Latontant, 2009; Harris, 2015; Wallace, 1980). Furthermore, as Ashely (2014) notes, there is a plethora of research demonstrating Black women's cognizance of the \"angry Black woman\" stereotype and of the negative consequences for being seen as such (see, e.g., Durr and VVingfield, 2011; Gon7.ale7.-Prendes & Thomas, 201 1; Lewis 8: Neville, 2015; VValley-Iean, 2009). Consequently, this produces a politics of silence (Higginbotham, 1994) in which many Black women feel that they must suppress their anger for fear of confirming this stereotype (Wingfield, 2007, 2010). Thus the ability of Black women to freely express anger is constrained and those who do so are often subjected to a great deal of scrutiny (Fritsch, 2015; Harris, 2015; VVingfie|d, 2010). However, anger is a universal emotion, a survival mechanism alerting us to harm (Lerner, 1997), so Black women suppressing their anger can lead to negative health outcomes (Ashely, 2014; West, 1995).'"

I'm fine with that. I just don't like the way they did it.\u201d \u201cThere's a better way to do things like this.\u201d So, a nonviolent gesture, when not on the field of play, to garner the attention of millions of people, and then following that up with a fairly clear verbal explanation of the whys of his protest and a million dollar donation to the work of reconciliation\u2014isn't the right way? These people don't mean that. They're lying, whether they know it or not. They're not all for protesting, at least not for someone who looks like Kaepernick looks. This is the arrogant heart of privilege: being the beneficiaries of systematic injustice, and then wanting to make the rules for the marginalized in how they should speak into that injustice. To these people who claim to offended, there are only two ways that Colin Kaepernick or any other person of color for that matter, can protest the \u201cright way\u201d: shut up or be white. This is the very limited menu we have for him and the black community when desiring change or equality or respect: wait for us to give it to you. That's not how America is supposed to work. Black voices matter. And that's the saddest takeaway from all this for me: the way white people so effortlessly illustrated exactly what Kaepernick was protesting. He was trying to give a voice to people who don't have one in the conversation, and he was badgered relentlessly by white people who tried to tone-police him into silence. The the more white Americans beat their breasts and tore their garments and broadcast their outrage at a civil, nonviolent expression of resistance by a man of color, the more they reminded us just why the conversation on race in America is so divisive and painful: because when the house is stacked for you, you don't really care to have the odds changed. Colin Kaepernick is nether silent nor white, and the way he protested was the right way because it was his way. Now, we in white America need to respond the right way, to him and those who he speaks for: we need to sit down and listen.'"

This ability to resonate is key, and in this way we can once again understand the difference that affect makes. The structural booby traps within the social that Brown warns us against are fueled by a belief in a pervading feeling of Nietzschean ressentiment dominating not only the actions, strategies, and tactics of social actors who do not automatically displace the particular or the singular for the general or universal. What Brown's theory of the impasse describes as wounded attachment depends on a belief in a stable and rigid affective field. But certain affective responses, especially unanticipatable ones, performed through comportment and behaviors that I have described as the wise Latina's repertoire of brown otherwiseness, inherently suggest another response to social wounding than the repetitive and unthinking attachment that Brown diagnoses as the problem plaguing the politics of many people, many of them brown, who reject an aspirational universalism. The example of Bustamante's dress, one associated with her Mexican heritage, being repeatedly shot again by the gun enthusiast may visually cohere to some aspects of Brown's theory of wounded attachment but differs in some crucial ways. Bustamante's performance aesthetics play with the idea of being a perpetually wounded subject trapped in the impasse of what amounts to a stalled singularity. But the artist's work symbolically, through her unpredictable response to this wounding, breaks off from Brown's idea of wounded attachment. Bustamante goads the shooter to continue firing. After the dress has been shot up, she inspects the bullet holes and gleefully reports that the Kevlar has caught the bullets and that she would have probably survived if she had been in the dress. She engages the visibly confused marksman, who reluctantly agrees that she probably would have survived. Bustamante, like Montez and Sotomayor, the other wise Latinas I have discussed, refused to take responsibility for the experience of those who would judge her. Instead, her work represents the refusal of the compulsory mimetic performance that is often thrust upon the minoritarian subject. Otherwiseness is a performance of affective noncompliance that is intrinsically linked to a sense of brownness that Jean-Luc Nancy would describe as a simultaneous being singular and plural.25 Our sense of singularity is knowable only in relation to the sense that is produced in relation to the plurality of singularities that constitute the world. Feeling brown is an aspect of a larger sense of brown that is simultaneously singular and plural. It is through feeling that we know, or more nearly sense, the brownness of the world and one another.'"

As long as the emergent Jacobin-centred public sphere refuses to seriously engage with what they have derisively termed \u201cidentity\u201d politics, it will alienate the most vital sections of a twenty-first century Marxist coalition and repeat the mistakes made by white socialist movements in the Western core throughout the twentieth century. As I will discuss in the conclusion, both Corbynism in the UK, and the Jacobin-centred public sphere more broadly, have much to gain from a serious engagement with what the latter have derisively termed \u201cidentitarian Leftism\u201d. Foregrounding the histories, victories, and struggles of indigenous, Black, queer, feminist, disabilities, and migrant movements and how they have successfully theorized and contested patriarchal, racial, capitalist, and imperialist hierarchies only deepens a socialist analysis and ensures that the failures of exclusionary, one-dimensional forms of organising are not repeated. I use the term Jacobin-centred public sphere advisedly. The magazine's wide range of published work includes a range of positions on race, gender, and class that can't easily be categorized as being simply for or against identity politics as such. Yet, a sense remains \u2013 one that is substantiated by the tone and the content of strong polemical interventions by Vivek Chibber, Walter Benn Michaels, Nivedita Majumdar, and Adolph Reed - that one story that Jacobin is always ready to tell is the story of the apparent betrayal of class politics by an American \u201cIdentitarian Left\u201d. The Fable of the Non-identitarian and identitarian Left The story goes something like this. There was once a non-identitarian left, a Left in America that emphasized nothing but class, that picked only the right battles and won them. This Left had its heyday in the unionist movements from the 1920s to the 1940s and brought about many of the victories of FDR's New Deal. It had all the strengths of a trade-unionist organization. It was working-class, firm, strong, and decisive. Then starting in the 1960s, with the cultural revolution and the emergence of a theoretically prolix post-modernism, a demonic identity politics emerged fully-formed \u2013 ready to be appropriated by the bourgeoisie and destroy this powerful class-first Left once and for all. These New Leftists got so obsessed with philosophical and literary speculation about cultural oppression that they lost track of the real issues. So keyed into \u2018intersectionality' were these identitarians that vigourous contestation against the boss fell by the wayside. In fact, Michaels suggests, this obsession with identity was a way for these \u2018Leftists' to mask their own complicity with the bourgeois ruling class in its legitimation of a diversified capitalism. These New Leftists retreated to the academy, conjuring up ever more intricate and complex critiques of capitalism without ever offering a clear picture of how to fight it. Chibber adds that the misfortune of \u201csocial theory classes\u201d in the last twenty-five years has been to make Leftists too obsessed with \u201cmargins\u201d, misunderstanding the centrality of the working-class as a revolutionary subject. And so these Jacobin contributors \u2013 often promoted and foregrounded in the Jacobin public sphere - registered their profound intellectual and political disagreement with the post-1960s academic and political Left. Intersectional thought, cultural politics, identity politics, all of these tendencies fragmented a united Left by focusing on the fragments and the margins. They created a Left too theory-minded to understand the bloody realities of capturing power. These elitist \u201cidentitarian\u201d academics and activists, born of the 1960s cultural revolutions, are held responsible for misunderstanding the basics of a Marxist class war and running the \u201cLeft\u201d into a cul-de-sac that they deserve to stay in if they keep insisting on their current modes of thought and action. The role of Jacobin or at least these rather polemical interventions in the Jacobin pages is to bring class back, to make the \u201cLeft\u201d Left again, to make the \u201cLeft\u201d great again; and get us going on the march to working-class victory. White Marxism? The elisions and confusions entailed in this anti-identitarian story go a long way in explaining why in many radical circles Jacobin is now seen, fairly or unfairly, as a white socialist magazine. A magazine intent on erasing all the historic gains made by feminists, Black, and indigenous radical movements in favour of a reductionist, white-centric politics that harks back to a supposed golden age of the 1940s [1]. First of all, words have meaning. When such senior academics and activists as Michaels, Reed, Chibber, and Majumdar go out of their way to single out \u201cintersectionality\u201d, frames of analysis that focuses on the \u201cmargins\u201d, and questions of \u201cidentity\u201d as responsible for the comprehensive abatement of class politics in the American left, they can't but be aware that they are not so subtly pinning the responsibility for this failure on Black feminists. After all, Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw's famous article, on how Black women's experiences of male violence are conditioned by specific intersections of racism and sexism in American society, an analysis then missed in antiracist and feminist debates, was titled \u201cMapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence Against Women of Color\u201d. Intersectionality as a political and intellectual project was developed by Black women scholars and activists to address the simple fact that as Black women, they are materially exploited, excluded, and subject to violence, due to distinct hierarchical structures that are largely ignored by a white, patriarchal, and racial capitalist society. In fighting and naming this oppression, they necessarily had to complicate easy unities of a given working-class identity, or even a unified Black experience to lay out precisely how patriarchal violence and racial capitalism affected Black women distinctly from how it affected white men, how it exploited Black working-class women differently from how it exploited white working-class men. If one reads anything in the Black feminist canon, such as books and articles by Audre Lorde, bell hooks, Angela Davis, Patricia Hill Collins, or Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, and this is not mentioning the hundreds of thousands of other scholars and activists who continue this work, one can scarcely get a sense that they are uninterested in class or have backgrounded capitalism and class politics for a simplistic \u201cidentitarianism\u201d. One wonders if those who propound this anti-Identitarian line have actually read a word of Black feminist literature at all. Idealist Fables Second, this anti-Identitarian fable is a profoundly idealist, and as such is an anti-Marxist, analysis of the history of the last sixty years. It presumes that the battle between labour and capital was won entirely by capital in the academies of the Western core. In this story, somehow simultaneously, Stuart Hall, Selma James, Silvia Federici, Robin D. G. Kelley, Judith Butler, and scores of other leading Leftists around the world nefariously invented post-modernism to fit the ideological requirements of neoliberalism and thus convinced their many students to stop fighting capital and instead take up fighting endless social media wars about culture and popular representations of identity. The contempt one must have for feminists' essential work on describing the mutual imbrication of patriarchy and capitalism \u2013 of the central role of gender in capitalist society's division of labour and its extraction of surplus value by rendering childcare and housework unpaid \u2013 to make this case is startling. On the one hand, the story completely misses the foundational new insights and frameworks that so many Marxists in so many different spaces and countries developed in understanding the racial, gendered, and imperial dimensions of modern capitalism. Dimensions that actively hinder worker-solidarity and worker-leadership and that must be understood to sustain any successful revolutionary politics. On the other hand, it deeply misunderstands the history of the post-1960s class struggle. Neoliberalism didn't win because post-modernism hypnotized the Western core's middle classes into somnolence. Neoliberalism won because the ruling classes fought and fought with the might of the state. Neoliberalism also won because the social-democratic parties that the middle-classes of the Western core continued to vote for essentially gave up on their working-class constituencies. Social-democratic parties that were supported by unions representing a labour aristocracy more interested in maintaining a nationalist class compromise with large firms than challenging the racial, gendered, and imperialist relations of expropriation which sustained Western economic growth. In the US, the Democratic party went on to break unions, retrenched the welfare state, perpetuated a racial backlash to Black power in the 1960s in the form of brutal mass incarceration, and undertook permanent war in the political-economic peripheries to shore up imperial value-chains. The very scholars and organizers who most astutely theorized, identified and enacted important acts of rebellion to halt the advance of heterosexist patriarchal imperialist capitalism \u2013 as bell hooks puts it - come under fire from Jacobin radicals for missing class altogether. The Freedom to make inconvenient Arguments? Now, those in the Jacobin public sphere who hold these views have responded to these critiques in two ways. One, they say that all the people named above are people of colour, and so to critique these academics as perpetuating a \u201cwhite socialism\u201d is to erase their identity and thus perpetuate a new form of erasure of POC views that are apparently \u201cinconvenient\u201d for most radicals. This is a bad-faith critique, because if the Jacobin public-sphere is against the confusions of identity politics altogether, then why put forward the identities of these scholars as relevant to the discussion at all? Presumably, this is to get at the arbitrariness and meaningless of one's identity positions in trying to explain one's political positions, and that a clean line cannot be drawn from the former to the latter. That to describe a person of colour's political analysis as \u201cwhite\u201d is to deny them the freedom to make inconvenient arguments. But if race, gender, and empire are central dimensions of contemporary capitalist exploitation, and we have seen above a series of writers who seem interested in minimizing these dimensions for a nationalist class-first analysis; the consequences of such an analysis are that by being blind to how class itself is racialized and gendered, it would fail to question the very hierarchies people of colour and feminists are trying to fight. Second, some in the Jacobin public sphere respond by lumping together feminists on the radical left and radical people of colour who make these substantial critiques with centrists and contemporary neoliberals who have weaponised a superficial politics of representation as a single, all-powerful group: the Identitarian left. Once again, any knowledge of the history of the Black, feminist, and LGBTQ movements in the US will yield the simple fact that they have been and continue to be heavily contested between liberal reformist and radical Marxist currents - among many others - and that no generalization can be made about these large mobilizations as inherently neo-liberal. These puzzling arguments merely heighten the sense that such anti-identitarian critiques are woefully under-theorised and are perhaps made to incite controversy and anger more than thought and action. The fact of the matter is that Jacobin's politics are already intersectional to some degree. That they consistently foreground the work of leading scholars and activists from all of the \u201cidentitarian\u201d movements suggests that they implicitly presuppose the radical victories that identity politics has won for the radical Left: the inclusion of women, people of colour, indigenous people, lesbian, gay, trans and queer people, and a principled international solidarity with anti-imperialist struggles around the world at the heart of radical politics. There seems to be no need to prosecute this clumsy culture-war against such a poorly defined identitarianism per se, especially one that pointedly appears to erase the significant contributions that Black feminists have made in theorizing and organizing large communities against neoliberalism; most recently in leading the Movement for Black Lives and bringing forward prison abolition as a central struggle in the fight against racial capitalism. Words have meaning, and they have consequences. Continuing to deplore \u201cthe margins\u201d as a frame of analysis and insisting on an imagined working-class unity will only continue to antagonize those on the Left who have long been organizing against patriarchal imperialist racial capitalism and will continue to do so, with or without certain Jacobin contributors' seal of approval on the effectiveness of their politics. Practical Consequences What are some other practical consequences of this line of analysis? One, it is perniciously false on its own terms and refuses to engage seriously with radical queer, feminist, Black, and internationalist political movements that have continued to contest patriarchal racial capitalism in the last forty years: from forcing American civil society, the state, insurance, and pharmaceutical industries to address the treatment of HIV/AIDS, to materially denting the ability of Israel to carry out business and promote apologia for its apartheid regime around the world, to building coalitions with prisoners that bring together violently policed working-class Black and Latino communities in deindustrialized cities (as Ruth Wilson Gilmore documents in \u201cGolden Gulag\u201d). Indeed, the recent legislative victory of forcing Republican senators to vote against their own healthcare bill was secured to a large extent by the courage and steadfast mobilization of disability rights campaigners in the past year. Through personal testimonies and consistently disruptive direct action, they have made it clear that Trump's healthcare bill is going to kill them; that their illnesses incur medical costs which they are not able to pay, that the rise in insurance premiums will be fatal. The lens of disability and race forcing us to confront the fact that capitalist healthcare is eugenics. If one tries to explain these victories as either identitarian reformism on the one hand, or inadequate grasps at class struggle on the other; one misses the significantly novel ways in which they have helped form radical communities that make a working-class rather than presume one. Finally, in failing to be internationalist, this kind of class-first analysis \u2013 one which relies on a notion of an accepted common sense which any socialist politics should effectively mobilize (a notion usefully criticized in this piece in New Socialist) fails to challenge pervasive white-supremacist and bourgeois ideas about who it is that constitutes a worker, and who a foreign parasite, who it is that can govern themselves and who needs to be policed, or deported. The temptation to mobilize what appears so obviously \u201cworking-class angst\u201d without interrogating how it is racialized and gendered or whether the targets are capitalists and not migrant workers is something UK Labour has consistently struggled with before and during the era of Blairism. In recent comments, Jeremy Corbyn offered a plainly false argument that it was the \u201cwholesale importation\u201d of Central European workers which destroyed labour conditions in the construction industry. As Maya Goodfellow argues here, migration doesn't bring down wages, union-busting does. Further, Corbyn's comments, like much discussion around Brexit, made no mention of non-EU nationals: Asian and African migrants living in the UK. Support for Leave and more broadly, support for \u201ccontrols on immigration\u201d is to a measurable degree driven by racial animus towards non-European migrants. A socialist Labour movement must respond by challenging these sentiments on the level of ideology and putting forth a clear legislative agenda for abolishing Theresa May's (and Tony Blair's) brutal Home Office and its ICE-like incarceration and deportation regime.'"

Kleypas, James I. McDougall, pp6-8.' | contents: 'There are-to start with-two kinds of histories of the university as an institution that may help us understand the dilemmas now confronting universities all over the world. In the Plan Bologna in Europe and at the meeting at Davos on the future of the university, learning is turned into a tool for efficiency and economic development whereby \"learning to manage\" becomes the central role in the corporate university? The task of learning to unlearn is urgent as far as management and efficiency are the terms of the rhetoric of modernity and progress that conceals the logic of coloniality and domination. For whom is management and efficiency beneficial'? In the recent past the world has witnessed two failures that were guided by the rhetoric of management and efficiency: the invasion of Iraq and the collapse of Wall Street. That route of knowing, the belief under which knowledge is created and arguments built, is no longer tenable. To imagine non-managerial futures based on the principle of \"living well\" rather than in efficiency and the belief (or make believe) that good management and efficiency will bring happiness to all is an ideal that benefits the elite who put forward the idea and can maintain it through various means (e.g., institutions, money, media). We need then to recap the history of higher learning in Western civilization. Because in its history the university has been linked to colonial expansion since the sixteenth century, and it is therefore imperial. Learning to unlearn is a decolonial endeavor in two senses: it is necessary to simultaneously decolonize imperial education and work towards decolonial education. Since the European Renaissance and European colonial expansion in the sixteenth century-that is, the foundational moment of the modern/colonial world-the accumulation of money has gone hand in hand with the accumulation of meaning and of knowledge. Today \"historical-structural dependency\" still structures the world, both economically and epistemically. How did that happen'? How was it possible that a local conception of knowledge, grounded on Greek and Roman experience and categories of thought, became hegemonic through various stages of five centuries of imperial expansion'? In what follows we will sketch how that happened and, in the end, we will advance some ideas of how to delink from that imperial legacy and engage in epistemic disobedience. Before engaging in that task, we need to identify the logic and the consequences of imperial thinking. Western categories of thought (grounded in Greek and Latin and translated into the six modern European imperial languages: Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, and English) put any other category in a double bind: either they are incorporated (and their singularity erased) into West.ern categories (e.g., transforming Hinduism and Buddhism into \"religions\") or they are dismissed and rejected, including all economies that are based on capitalist principles and knowledges that cannot be assimilated into Western nonnativization of life and subjectivities, from govermnents to \"popular\" knowledge (e.g., Vandana Sl1iva's report on traditional knowledge of the forest or the administration of water in conditions of water scarcity). The logic of Western imperial epistemology consists of a meta-discourse that validates itself by disqualifying difference. That is, it consists of making and remaking epistemic colonial difference: barbarian, primitives, Orientals, Indians, and blacks are qualified as people \"outside\" or \"behind\" who need to be brought into the modern present. Modernity then is not a historical epoch, but an imperial category of self-validation and disqualification of the epistemic difference. Take philosophy of science, for example. Once these categories of knowledge have been institutionalized in Western scholarship and translated into common sense (or in Western appropriation of Greek and Roman legacies), they become totalitarian, preventing any other kind of knowledge from being recognized at the same level as philosophy and sciences. Political theory (democracy) or political economy (capitalism) are similar examples; after the financial crisis of 2008-2009 the main issue in the media and higher-learning institutions was how to save capitalism, not to ask if another economic system (based on reciprocity instead of gain and accumulation that promotes destruction and killing in all forms, from wars to food crises) were viable. Learning to unlearn means to delink from the illusion that knowledge in all spheres of life is bound to one set of categories that are both universal and Western. To start shifting the geo-politics of knowledge, delinking and engaging in epistemic disobedience, it is necessary to excavate the foundation of Western categories and principles about the knowledge itself and the values attached to certain kinds of knowledge used to devalue epistemic differences: that is, building and maintaining the epistemic colonial difference that reverts and complements imperial epistemic differences. For example, Mandarin, Russian, and Arabic to name a few languages spoken by billions of people are not languages sustainable in the epistemic world order. Knowing how and critical thinking can be found in any community. Knowing how is a matter of surviving and living in a community. But with knowing /1011' comes knowing that, which is the first level of theoretical knowing. Knowing what projects theoretical knowing into a level of complexity in which other doings and thinking enter into consideration: knowing w/mt is the theoretical level that operates in the domain of options. One perhaps could say that the Greek breakthrough was to move from knowing that to knowing what and the achievement of Western civilization was to capitalize on it: theology, philosophy and sciences are three disciplinary formations responding to the same basic principles upon which knowing what has been built. Exploring and unveiling such principles have become an urgent task for decolonial humanities in confrontation with corporate values of management and efficiency. Therefore, decolonial humanities means epistemic disobedience (since critiquing the foundation of Western knowledge while accepting Western epistemic rules of the game will not go very far-it will remain within an obedient kind of criticism) and delinking. It means learning to unlearn (delinking, epistemic disobedience)'"
